        \ S. J.</dc:contributor>\n<dc:subject>Education, Language and Literature</dc:subject>\n\
        <dc:description>In this study, a bi-disciplinary approach was taken to investigate\
        \ translation processes with the objective of establishing the foundation\
        \ for a systematic approach to the teaching of translation skills for professional\
        \ purposes. A model of translation in terms of social, communicative processes\
        \ was developed on the basis of the view of language proposed by J. R. Firth.\
        \ This social view of translation was complemented by a model of cognitive\
        \ translation processes based on a contemporary view of psycholinguistic language\
        \ processing as well as on empirical data collected in the form of think-aloud\
        \ protocols. The verbal report data were collected during the production of\
        \ a German $\\to$ English translation, carried out by eight novice translator\
        \ trainees in a West German university program in Translation Studies, and\
        \ eight graduates of the same program.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>A\
        \ coding procedure was developed that provided a graphic representation of\
        \ a variety of cognitive processing indicators. It was found that intuitive\
        \ cognitive processes were involved in the translation of virtually all of\
        \ the translation units identified in the data. No differences were found\
        \ between the novice and professional subjects with respect to: the types\
        \ of controlled processes used, the preponderance of controlled or uncontrolled\
        \ processes implemented, or the quality of their translation products. These\
        \ findings suggest that (a) rather than being applied in well-planned sequences,\
        \ controlled translation strategies tend to be used on an ad hoc basis to\
        \ provide additional raw material for uncontrolled processes, and (b) graduates\
        \ of translator training programs may be no more competent to translate into\
        \ their second language than are novices.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The\
        \ study concludes that systematic approaches to translation skills instruction\
        \ must differentiate between general communicative skills and translation-specific\
        \ skills and knowledge, and that the development of communicative competence\
        \ must become a main priority in translator training. Recent developments\
        \ in Communicative Second Language Teaching and isolated initiatives from\
        \ within the field of Translation Studies are suggested as appropriate sources\
        \ of innovation for translation skills instruction.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2011-05-07T13:32:41Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>In recent years, the second language teaching profession has\
        \ increasingly adopted peer discussion techniques as a means of improving\
        \ both the quantity and the quality of classroom language practice opportunities.\
        \ There is sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that peer interaction\
        \ provides increased amounts of comprehensible and negotiated linguistic input.\
        \ However, there has been little research into the ways in which classroom\
        \ task types, and the classroom context itself, may affect learners' conversational\
        \ strategies. As a result, little is known of the manner in which these activities\
        \ may be considered to promote communicative competence in addition to linguistic\
        \ ability.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This project, based upon a pilot\
        \ study completed in December 1987, investigates the conversations of intermediate\
        \ students of French as they perform tasks regularly assigned in classrooms\
        \ in two university level instructional settings. Four task types, exerting\
        \ variable amounts of control upon the nature of the discourse, were selected\
        \ for inclusion in the study. A total of 32 dyads from four intermediate French\
        \ classes participated. The students were audio recorded as they performed\
        \ the tasks, and the tapes were transcribed for analysis. A survey of learner\
        \ attitudes toward the tasks was administered when the conversational data\
        \ had been gathered in each class.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Analysis\
        \ includes: (1) descriptions of discourse dynamics, including distribution\
        \ of turns-at-talk, topic management, repair strategies and negotiation for\
        \ meaning, (2) a summary of findings from learner attitude surveys, and (3)\
        \ quantitative analysis, including ratios of words per minute, counts of communication\
        \ units within a time limit, and type/token ratios indicating the variety\
        \ of vocabulary employed.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This project is\
        \ descriptive in nature, and therefore does not address the issue of eventual\
        \ learning outcomes. However, in describing the learning experiences made\
        \ available to students through pair work (and by contrast, those which are\
        \ not) the project contributes to an understanding of one aspect of classroom\
        \ discourse. It is hoped that these insights will eventually permit informed\
        \ use of peer discussion techniques in second language classrooms.</dc:description>\n\

        \ language typology and L2 acquisition: A cross-sectional study of adult English\
        \ speakers learning Chinese</dc:title>\n<dc:contributor>Saville-Troike, Muriel</dc:contributor>\n\
        <dc:subject>Language, Linguistics</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Education, Educational\
        \ Psychology</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>This study is an attempt to integrate\
        \ the theories of language universals, language typology, and markedness with\
        \ interlanguage (IL) phenomena, specifically those relating to the process\
        \ of acquiring Chinese as a second language. The central question addressed\
        \ is whether or not a composite theory of universals and typological parameters\
        \ can account for IL process in terms of developmental patterns, learning\
        \ difficulty, and possibility of transfer.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>A\
        \ total of 86 subjects who are native speakers of English learning Chinese\
        \ as a second language participated in the two studies. Four tasks were used\
        \ in order to measure the Ss' overall performance on Chinese word order (core\
        \ and peripheral), Chinese aspect marking, Chinese topic-comment structures,\
        \ and the pragmatic functions of Chinese ba, jiu, and cai. The ultimate purpose\
        \ of the tests was to examine the effect of parameter setting with regard\
        \ to head-initial/head-final, topic-prominent/subject-prominent, and pragmatically\
        \ governed word order/grammatically governed word order, and lexical/inflectional\
        \ marking.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The findings of this study indicate\
        \ that second language acquisition is influenced by language universals, language\
        \ typology, markedness hierarchy, as well as cognitive processes and strategies\
        \ such as transfer, overgeneralization, and simplification. Evidence from\
        \ the pragmaticization in Chinese L2 acquisition indicates the different stages\
        \ learners go through in setting a semantic-pragmatic framework from sentence\
        \ and discourse interpretation. The relative difficulty of this process supports\
        \ Givon's (1979) claims for the effects of L1 on L1 syntacticization processes\
        \ and contradicts the claim by Fuller and Gundel (1987) for a universal topic-comment\
        \ stage in interlanguage. Finally, it is shown that transfer and other learning\
        \ processes may not appear in surface-level comparisons, but at a more abstract\
        \ level of linguistic analysis. Interlanguage studies should use investigative\
        \ procedures which use typological differences between L1 and L2 as a basic\
        \ point of departure. (Abstract shortened with permission of author.)</dc:description>\n\

        \ an ethnographic account of life at a regulatory agency to offer a new perspective\
        \ on an important question: how does a regulatory agency become and remain\
        \ independent? Relying on an analytical framework based on scholarship in\
        \ legal anthropology, this study provides elements of an answer based on an\
        \ insider???s view of regulation, illuminating the complex, messy, and political\
        \ nature of what may seem from the outside as calm and neutral application\
        \ of technical expertise. &#13;\nThe formal account suggests that legislative\
        \ action defines the position and mandate of such an agency making it independent???immune\
        \ from political influence in its decision-making. However, experience has\
        \ shown that the making and maintenance of independence is a challenge, especially\
        \ as these agencies typically enter arenas much after other powerful economic\
        \ and political interests have established their own positions. The result\
        \ is that in spite of efforts of international financial institutions, governments,\
        \ and regulatory staffers worldwide to create independent regulatory agencies,\
        \ many of these agencies are severely constrained in their ability to function\

        \ regulatory staffers are constantly struggling to make and maintain their\
        \ position, define their role, and keep their agency going. These individuals\
        \ engage in strategic choice-making, applying ideas and creating rituals in\
        \ their various attempts to define a role for the agency. Even if they could\
        \ call upon a formal mandate as defined in the law, the agency???s position\
        \ is largely determined through the actions of the individuals working at\
        \ the agency and, interestingly, through the actions of other entities in\
        \ the arena. The role and position of the regulatory agency thus has various\
        \ sources and is defined through multiple activities, including the act of\
        \ regulation itself.&#13;\nIf regulation is political, this study proposes\
        \ rethinking regulation in terms of its semi-independence. A regulatory agency???s\
        \ procedures and decisions are all part of the attempt of that agency to define\
        \ a role for itself and are, consequently, political in nature. This political\
        \ behavior is shaped by the preferences, values, and relative positions of\
        \ other entities in the arena. By engaging in such political behavior, the\
        \ agency becomes semi-independent; it might not be an apolitical rule-applier,\
        \ but it may also be able to define a more meaningful role for itself. Rethinking\
        \ regulatory independence as an ongoing effort thus situates an agency within\
        \ political and social contexts, allowing us a new perspective on this widespread\
        \ activity.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2011-05-25T14:27:25Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2011-05-25T14:27:25Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:subject>politics</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>This dissertation traces\
        \ the ways in which nineteenth-century fictional narratives of white settlement\
        \ represent ???family??? as, on the one hand, an abstract theoretical model\
        \ for a unified and relatively homogenous British settler empire and on the\
        \ other, a fundamental challenge to ideas about imperial integrity and transnational\
        \ Anglo-Saxon racial identification. I argue that representations of transoceanic\
        \ white families in nineteenth-century fictions about Australian settler colonialism\
        \ negotiate the tension between the bounded domesticity of an insular English\
        \ nation and the kind of kinship that spans oceans and continents as a result\
        \ of mass emigration from the British isles to the United States, Canada,\
        \ New Zealand, and the Australian colonies. As such, these fictions construct\
        \ productive analogies between the familial metaphors and affective language\
        \ in the political discourse of ???Greater Britain??????-a transoceanic imagined\
        \ community of British settler colonies and their ???mother country??? united\
        \ by race and language???-and ideas of family, gender, and domesticity as\
        \ they operate within specific bourgeois families.  Concerns over the disruption\
        \ of transoceanic families bear testament to contradictions between the idea\
        \ of a unified imperial identity (both British and Anglo-Saxon), the proliferation\
        \ of fractured local identities (such as settlers??? English, Irish Catholic,\
        \ and Australian nationalisms), and the conspicuous absence of indigenous\
        \ families from narratives of settlement.&#13;\n&#13;\nI intervene at the\
        \ intersection of postcolonial literary criticism and gender theory by examining\
        \ the strategic deployments of heteronormative kinship metaphors and metonymies\
        \ in the rhetorical consolidation of settler colonial space. Settler colonialism\
        \ was distinct from the ???civilizing??? domination of subject peoples in\
        \ South Asia in that it depended on the rhetorical construction of colonial\
        \ territory as empty space or as land occupied by nearly extinct ???primitive???\
        \ races. This dissertation argues that political rhetoric, travel narratives,\
        \ and fiction used the image of white female bourgeois reproductive power\
        \ and sentimental attachment as a technology for settler colonial success,\
        \ embodying this technology both in the benevolent figure of the metropolitan\
        \ ???mother country??? (the paternalistic female counter to the material realities\
        \ of patriarchal and violent settler colonial practices) and in fictional\
        \ juxtapositions of happy white settler fecund families with the solitary\
        \ self-extinguishing figure of the black aboriginal ???savage.??? Yet even\
        \ in the narratives where the continuity and coherence of families across\
        \ imperial space is questioned???-and ???Greater Britain??? itself???-domesticity\
        \ and heteronormative familial relations effectively rewrite settler space\
        \ as white, Anglo-Saxon and bourgeois, and the sentimentalism of troubled\
        \ European families masks the presence and genocide of indigenous aboriginal\
        \ peoples.&#13;\n&#13;\nI analyze a range of novels and political texts, canonical\
        \ and non-canonical, metropolitan and colonial. My introductory first chapter\
        \ examines the discourse on a ???Greater Britain??? in the travel narratives\
        \ of J.A. Froude, Charles Wentworth Dilke, and Anthony Trollope and in the\
        \ Oxbridge lectures of Herman Merivale and J.R. Seeley. These writers make\
        \ arguments for an imperial economy of affect circulating between Britain\
        \ and the settler colonies that reinforces political connections, and at times\
        \ surpasses the limits of political possibility by relying on the language\
        \ of sentiment and feeling to build a transoceanic ???Greater British??? community.\
        \ Subsequent chapters show how metropolitan and colonial fiction writers,\
        \ including Charles Dickens, Anthony Trollope, Marcus Clarke, Henry Kingsley,\
        \ and Catherine Helen Spence, test the viability of this ???Greater British???\
        \ economy of affect by presenting transoceanic family connections and structures\
        \ straining under the weight of forces including the vast distances between\
        \ colonies and the ???mother country,??? settler violence, and the transportation\
        \ system.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2011-08-26T15:24:19Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2013-08-27T10:00:24Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>The high complexity of modern software, and our pervasive\
        \ reliance on that software, has made the problems of software reliability\
        \ increasingly important. Yet despite advances in software engineering practice,\
        \ pre-release testing, and automated analysis, reports of highsoftware engineering\
        \ practice, pre-release testing, and automated analysis, reports of highprofile&#13;\n\
        production failures are still common. This dissertation proposes several run-time\
        \ techniques to analyze and alleviate software failures dynamically, during\
        \ production runs.&#13;\n&#13;\nThe first technique is low overhead checkpoint,\
        \ rollback, and re-execution. By allowing a window of time in which a period\
        \ of execution can be relived, low overhead checkpointing allows expensive\
        \ analytical steps to be saved for only when they are needed. The second technique\
        \ is a collection of dynamically insertable run-time analysis tools, which\
        \ can use information gleaned over multiple analytical runs of the same execution\
        \ to incrementally build picture of a production run failure more completely\
        \ than any individual analysis could. Finally, based on my experience with\
        \ the behavior of programs under failure, and the underlying causes of said\
        \ failures, this dissertation introduces the concept of, and provides a run\
        \ time which supports, delta execution. Delta execution is the process of\
        \ running more than one instance or version of a program, while sharing the\
        \ majority of issued instructions and state. This dissertation uses delta\
        \ execution specifically to validate software patches at production run time.&#13;\n\
        &#13;\nThese three techniques have been demonstrated in three implemented\
        \ systems supporting various end-level reliability goals. The first system,\
        \ called Sweeper, is a run-time defensive system against security bugs. Low\
        \ overhead checkpointing captures system state until an intrusion tripwire\
        \ notices an anomaly. The system can then roll back to perform a more thorough\
        \ (and expensive) analysis of past execution to determine the nature of the\
        \ exploit. Because of the low overhead of the initial checkpointing, the barriers\
        \ to widespread deployment are low. Further, because Sweeper can still perform\
        \ more complex analysis, there is the opportunity to generate strong protective\
        \ measures, like vulnerability specific execution filters (or VSEFs), which\
        \ can effectively stop a worm infestation. The implemented Sweeper system\
        \ imposes only 1% overhead in ordinary operation, and can generate an effective\
        \ protective measure in only 60 milliseconds. From an analytic model, this\
        \ is sufficient to minimize the spread of a fast worm to only 5% of the susceptible\
        \ hosts, even for a worm which spreads 10,000 times faster than any previously\
        \ observed in the wild.&#13;\n&#13;\nThe second system is called Triage. Rather\
        \ than improving reliability by improving security, Triage attempts to enable\
        \ the improvement of the underlying code by automating&#13;\nfailure diagnosis\
        \ of production run systems. Production run failures are difficult to address.\
        \ Such failures commonly are irreproducible in a development environment due\
        \ to workload or scale issues. As they occured in a production run, these\
        \ are clearly faults which were not caught and fixed by the developer???s\
        \ standard pre-release testing. Finally, production runs have stringent restrictions\
        \ on overhead and privacy. Hence giving the programmer enough insight into\
        \ the failure to implement a patch is challenging. Triage addresses this by\
        \ performing failure diagnosis post-hoc at the end-user???s site. Low overhead\
        \ checkpointing allows the capture of a failing execution, so expensive analysis\
        \ can be deferred until it is definitely needed. Repeated replays allows the\
        \ incremental application of a variety of failure analysis techniques, similar\
        \ to the process a human programmer may undertake. For analysis which generally\
        \ takes direction from a human, Triage substitutes the results of previous\
        \ analytical steps. Overall, Triage imposes only 5% overhead in failure free\
        \ execution, and, if a failure occurs, all of the analysis which requires\
        \ re-execution is complete within about 5 minutes. In a study with human programmers,\
        \ the output of Triage analysis reduced the time to patch real software faults\
        \ by 45%.&#13;\n&#13;\nThe third system presented in this dissertation deals\
        \ with the problems introduced when programmers make changes. Despite testing\
        \ before release, a large number of software&#13;\npatches are released buggy.\
        \ Indeed, software patches are generally of such poor quality that to optimize\
        \ uptime it is better to delay applying even security patches while others\
        \ act as ???volunteer??? beta testers uncovering the faults which made it\
        \ though the vendor???s quality control. However, as Triage???s novel delta\
        \ analysis diagnostic tool shows, the difference between correct and buggy\
        \ execution can be minimal. Indeed, a manual study of software patches described\
        \ in this dissertation shows that many patches should not create large changes\
        \ in the underlying execution. Hence this dissertation proposes delta execution.\
        \ If the execution (in terms of instruction streams and data) of the patched\
        \ and unpatched versions of a program are mostly identical, then it is possible\
        \ to run both versions mostly in one instruction stream. Only rarely, when\
        \ the executions do differ, is it necessary to run two sets of instructions.\
        \ By only running the differing, or delta, segments separately, delta execution\
        \ allows low overhead production run patch validation which is 12% faster\
        \ than side-by-side patch validation. Further (and perhaps more important),\
        \ many of the effects which make patch validation difficult (multithreading,\
        \ timing sensitivity, and system level nondeterminism) are nullified as they\
        \ effect the two logical executions inside the one physical execution identically.\
        \ This dissertation shows that, of ten applications tested, delta execution\
        \ can validate all of the patches, while traditional side-by-side validation\
        \ only manages to validate 2.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-02-06T20:12:18Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ hardware verification is a non-probabilistic process that verifies the adherence\
        \ of a design to a non-probabilistic performance specification. However, adaptive\
        \ techniques like voltage and frequency scaling, process variations due to\
        \ shrinking chip geometries and input variations for accommodating \"better-than-worst-case\"\
        \ design contribute significantly to the stochastic nature of contemporary\
        \ chips. Therefore, it is desirable to incorporate probabilistic reasoning\
        \ in the verification paradigm. Moreover, if such probabilistic verification\
        \ can be applied at the register transfer level (RTL), it would facilitate\
        \ better choices early in the hardware design cycle.&#13;\n&#13;\nIn this\
        \ thesis, we introduce the SHARPE (Statistical High-level Analysis and Rigorous\
        \ Performance Estimation) methodology. Our SHARPE methodology is a rigorous,\
        \ systematic approach to verify design correctness in RTL in the presence\
        \ of variations. We construct macromodels to transfer low-level hardware information,\
        \ such as timing, to the higher RTL. We treat the RTL source code as a program\
        \ and use static program analysis techniques to propagate signal probabilities.\
        \ We combine the information obtained from both static analysis and the macromodels\
        \ and model the RTL design as a statistical entity. We then employ formal\
        \ probabilistic analysis on this probabilistic RTL model in order to compute\
        \ the required probabilistic metric. The use of formal analysis makes our\
        \ methodology high in confidence as opposed to simulation-based methods.&#13;\n\
        &#13;\nOur SHARPE methodology can be applied to both combinational and sequential\
        \ designs. In combinational designs, formal probabilistic analysis is performed\
        \ by exhaustively testing all possible input vectors. In sequential designs,\
        \ we represent the probabilistic RTL models as discrete time Markov chains\
        \ (DTMCs) that are then checked formally for probabilistic invariants using\
        \ PRISM, a probabilistic model checker. When posed with a query, PRISM performs\
        \ formal probabilistic analysis by exploring all possible transitions of the\
        \ DTMC model.&#13;\n&#13;\nFormal probabilistic analysis is known to be infeasible\
        \ for large RTL designs. We improve the scalability of our SHARPE methodology\
        \ by using sound symmetry reductions, automatic compositional reasoning and\
        \ value-based interval abstractions in the design source code. For very large\
        \ RTL designs, we employ statistical model checking, a scalable simulation-based\
        \ alternative to probabilistic model checking. Since simulation-based analysis\
        \ is not exhaustive, verification by statistical model checking is inexact.\
        \ However, the statistical model checker guarantees the verification results\
        \ to be within specified bounds of error.&#13;\n&#13;\nIn this thesis, we\
        \ demonstrate several applications of our SHARPE methodology. We first show\
        \ how our SHARPE methodology can provide statistical timing estimates in RTL\
        \ in the presence of either input variations or process variations. We then\
        \ modify the macromodels used by our methodology  and use them to obtain RTL\
        \ estimates of aging resulting from negative bias temperature instability\
        \ (NBTI) effects. We describe how our methodology can be extended to compute\
        \ bit error rates (BER) that are commonly-used performance metrics for RTL\
        \ designs of wireless communication systems. For RTL of large multicore designs,\
        \ we employ statistical model checking to provide guarantees regarding the\
        \ performance of dynamic power management schemes. We perform our experiments\
        \ on both benchmark RTL designs and real-world RTL designs.</dc:description>\n\

        \ Malthusian Paradox: Weapons Rhetoric Before the Bomb is a longitudinal case\
        \ study of weapons rhetoric leading up to WWII. It examines how influential\
        \ weapons rhetors negotiated a technological conundrum that I call the ???Malthusian\
        \ Paradox.??? The Malthusian Paradox is the commonplace belief that while\
        \ technology will destroy humanity, technology also provides humanity???s\
        \ only means of preservation. The Malthusian Paradox not only clarifies what\
        \ Thomas R. Malthus thought about populations and political economy at the\
        \ end of the 18th century in London, but it also clarifies an enduring pattern\
        \ of deliberation about technology???s effects on overpopulation, globalization,\
        \ and war. This scheme of ideas began to inform how rhetors navigated weapons\
        \ discourse, and in turn, the proliferation of the Paradox in weapons rhetoric\
        \ reiterated and re-inscribed the concept such that it has acquired an aura\
        \ of permanence, immutability, and inescapability. The Malthusian Paradox\
        \ thus refers not just to a person, but also to the conundrum he presented\
        \ to modern society, the manner of thought it germinated, and a persistent\
        \ technology rhetoric ??? all of which have a continuing history. Thereby,\
        \ the Paradox has become a foundational figurative and argumentative principle\
        \ of technology.&#13;\n\tI argue that the Malthusian Paradox can be construed\
        \ as a gauge to compare and assess the strategies and tactics of weapons rhetors\
        \ communicating in discrete historical contexts across time. I therefore implement\
        \ a longitudinal case study that combines close textual analyses of specific\
        \ documents with historical analyses of how weapons and their compatible technological\
        \ logics developed. I suggest that analyzing how weapons rhetors negotiate\
        \ the Malthusian Paradox grants insight into how people have invented the\
        \ current technological conditions, understand war, formulate ideologies,\
        \ and get anxious about weapons. The case studies examine Malthus???s Essay\
        \ on the Principle of Population (1798), accused Haymarket bomb conspirator\
        \ August Spies???s courtroom address (1886), Amos A. Fries???s and Clarence\
        \ J. West???s army textbook Chemical Warfare (1921), and selected correspondence\
        \ and Manhattan Project memos of nuclear physicist Leo Szilard. As rhetoric\
        \ and the Paradox smashed into each other over the historical development\
        \ of weapons, certain overriding strategies have emerged, demonstrating that\
        \ many of the rhetorical tactics and strategies associated with the Bomb and\
        \ modern-day terrorism have much older origins. These overriding strategies\
        \ function as windows into what might be thought of as the dominant network\
        \ of weapons discourse that help to constitute their political and ideological\
        \ presence in the world, and bring populations ???before the Bomb.???</dc:description>\n\

        \ data-analytic (CIDA) applications have become a major component of many\
        \ different business domains, as well as scientific computing applications.\
        \ &#13;\nThese algorithms stem from domains as diverse as web analysis and\
        \ social networks, machine learning and data mining, text analysis, bio-informatics,\
        \ astronomy image analysis, business analytics, large scale graph algorithms,\
        \ image/video processing and recognition, some high performance computing\
        \ problems, quantitative finance and simulation among others. These computational\
        \ problems deal with massive data sets, and require performing lots of computation\
        \ per data element. &#13;\n&#13;\nThis thesis presents a vision of CIDA applications\
        \ programmed in a MapReduce style framework and running on clusters of accelerators.\
        \ Regardless of the type of accelerator, whether GPUs (NVIDIA or AMD), other\
        \ manycore architectures (like Intel Larrabee or MIC) or even heterogeneous\
        \ chips (AMD Fusion or IBM Cell processor), there is a fundamental condition\
        \ imposed on the software, namely the increased sensitivity to locality. As\
        \ a result, the common theme in this thesis is to increase the locality in\
        \ CIDA applications. &#13;\n&#13;\nWe report on four research efforts to achieve\
        \ this goal. The Multiple independent threads on a heterogeneous resource\
        \ architecture (MITHRA) project integrates Hadoop MapReduce and GPUs together,\
        \ where the map() functions execute. As a result, by moving the map() functions\
        \ to GPUs we increase the locality of reference and gain better performance.&#13;\n\
        We have shown that when the MITHRA model is applicable (for instance for Monte\
        \ Carlo algorithms), each computing node can perform orders of magnitude more\
        \ work in the same run-time.&#13;\n&#13;\nThen we introduce partitioned iterative\
        \ convergence (PIC) as an approach to realize iterative algorithms on clusters.\
        \ We observed that conventional implementations of iterative algorithms using\
        \ MapReduce are quite inefficient as a result of several factors. Complementary\
        \ to prior work, we focused on addressing the challenges of high network traffic\
        \ due to frequent model updates and lack of parallelism across iterations.\
        \ &#13;\nPIC has two phases. In the first phase, called the best-effort phase,\
        \ it partitions the problem and runs the sub-problems in individual cluster\
        \ nodes, where the locality can be exploited better. &#13;\nThe results of\
        \ this phase can be numerically inaccurate (about 3\\% based on experimental\
        \ results), but can be computed much faster. The second phase of PIC, called\
        \ the top-off phase, runs the original iterative algorithm a few more iterations\
        \ (starting with the results of the best-effort phase) to compute an accurate\
        \ answer.&#13;\n&#13;\nFinally we introduce two GPU-based projects that try\
        \ to increase the performance of MapReduce style functions in GPUs. The first\
        \ is loop maximizing, a code transformation for GPUs that can eliminate code\
        \ flow divergence (and hence serialization in GPUs) and result in better usage\
        \ of GPU processing elements. Using this technique, we have achieved the highest\
        \ reported speedups for gene alignment algorithms.&#13;\nThe second GPU-based\
        \ project is a library for dynamic shared memory allocation and access in\
        \ GPUs assuming independent execution of the GPU threads, which happens in\
        \ a MapReduce style environment among both map() and reduce() functions. &#13;\n\
        &#13;\nThe two MapReduce adaptations (MITHRA and PIC), the GPU-based loop-maximizing\
        \ optimization and the Plasma library together lay the plan for the goal of\
        \ achieving good performance on locality-sensitive clusters. This thesis shows\
        \ the feasibility of this approach, and describes how each of these projects\
        \ contributes to the collective target.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2013-02-03T19:28:12Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ of online discussion groups for mothers and fathers of young children (prior\
        \ to the entry in kindergarten) with an autism spectrum disorder. Over a 12\
        \ week time period, parents (15 mothers and 7 fathers) participated in gender-divided\
        \ online discussion groups. Three online surveys were used to determine discussion\
        \ topics of importance, to identify services and supports already accessed,\
        \ and to report parent satisfaction in participation. Fathers and mothers\
        \ identified similar topic choices for discussion although mothers indicated\
        \ sleeping and toilet training as higher priorities than fathers. Similarities\
        \ and differences were identified between the parent groups in their styles\
        \ of discussion postings. Fathers engaged in more lurking (viewing without\
        \ posting) behavior and only mothers used emotional support statements (indicating\
        \ understanding and sympathy) and esteem supportive-compliments in their discussions.\
        \ New subthemes of Sharing Statements-Information, Sharing Statements-Questions,\
        \ and Building Relationships through Humor emerged. Mothers found the online\
        \ discussion groups more useful than fathers, but both indicated they would\
        \ recommend online discussion groups such as this one. The access to new ideas,\
        \ the presence of others in a shared situation, and a sense of belonging to\
        \ a supportive community were reasons mothers found participation useful.\
        \ Fathers noted the access to others??? perspectives and contact with others\
        \ sharing the same challenges as reasons the online groups were useful. Limitations\
        \ of the study and implications for research and practice are discussed.</dc:description>\n\

        \ United States and many other countries are conducting a major upgrade of\
        \ their electrical grids. The new ???smart grid??? is not a physically isolated\
        \ network like the older power grid was, but a complicated network of networks.\
        \ That greatly increases the security concerns, ranging from hackers who gain\
        \ access to control networks or create denial-of-service attacks on the networks\
        \ themselves, to accidental causes, such as natural disasters or operator\
        \ errors. Therefore, it is critical to build a safe, resilient and secure\
        \ communication environment for protecting the smart grid. Under this central\
        \ theme, our research work has two strongly correlated streams.&#13;\nFirst,\
        \ to analyze large-scale networked systems (e.g., smart grid communication\
        \ networks) with high fidelity, it is necessary for a testing system to offer\
        \ both effective emulation (to represent critical software execution) and\
        \ realistic simulation (to model background computation and communication).\
        \ We have developed a network testbed using both parallel simulation and virtual-\
        \ machine-based, virtual-time-embedded emulation to provide both functional\
        \ and temporal fidelity for running large-scale networking experiments, so\
        \ that technologies can be appropriately evaluated with modeling and simulation\
        \ methodologies as well as with real software/hardware testing before they\
        \ are integrated into the grid.&#13;\nSecond, we have utilized the testbed\
        \ to study various cyber attacks in the smart grid, including a distributed\
        \ denial-of-service attack (DDoS) in an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI)\
        \ and an event buffer flooding attack on a supervisory control and data acquisition\
        \ (SCADA) system (both for the Trustworthy Cyber Infrastructure for the Power\
        \ Grid (TCIPG) Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign),\
        \ and also used it to evaluate a demand response design in a hierarchical\
        \ transactive control network (as part of the Pacific Northwest smart grid\
        \ demonstration project).</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2013-08-22T16:39:52Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ in a long history of social panic over females??? lack of safety with new\
        \ communication technologies, in the US, society has defined adolescent-aged\
        \ females using social media in a familiar binary fashion: they are either\
        \ ???at-risk??? or  ???reckless??? in their involvements (Cassell &amp; Cramer,\
        \ 2007; Standage, 1998). This dissertation is an ethnographic study of rural,\
        \ teenaged American young women that challenges this view. It employs Lesko\
        \ (2001) and Gray???s (2009) critical perspectives on youth identities to\
        \ look beyond the fear and danger traditionally associated with adolescence\
        \ and with girls??? sociality to consider the broad role social media play\
        \ in their lives. This ethnography investigates the meaning and context of\
        \ actions taken by young rural females on Facebook and Twitter that are judged\
        \ by adults and institutions as risky from within the framing of adolescence.&#13;\n\
        Looking closely at what is really risky within this milieu, this study finds\
        \ these teens facing frustrations in restrictive, monitored, censoring, and\
        \ contained life in their homes and communities are attempting to flee to\
        \ ???spaces??? in social media where they are able to gain social involvement\
        \ and perform their identities without fear of reprisal. Teens report that\
        \ the poor treatment they receive in their day-to-day lives within the context\
        \ of modern adolescence drives them into what I term ???social media migration.???\
        \ In the hopes of escaping offline containment, surveillance, and misinterpretation,\
        \ these teens travel alone to and through online spaces to set up temporary\
        \ walls of ???public privacy??? that allow them to perform desired identities\
        \ away from parents??? watchful eyes. Social media migration is undertaken\
        \ by these young women intentionally to claim social spaces that they feel\
        \ will allow them new opportunities to interact, to gain visibility for non-childish\
        \ identities, and to craft counternarratives to trouble their offline marginality.\
        \ &#13;\nWrit large, this research suggests that these teens do, in fact,\
        \ find themselves in perilous positions in their life in social media. However,\
        \ it finds that other analyses failed to capture the actual risks entailed\
        \ in young women???s social media use because researchers directed attention\
        \ to youth blaming and re-tooling, and away from important larger structures\
        \ of power involved in both social Internet technologies and adolescent marginality.</dc:description>\n\

        \ infrastructures are highly integrated systems composed of many complex interactions\
        \ between different system modules or agents including cyber and physical\
        \ components as well as human factors. Their growing complexity demands novel\
        \ design techniques for scalable and efficient control and computations for\
        \ providing system security and resilience. This dissertation develops new\
        \ game-theoretic frameworks for addressing security and resilience problems\
        \ residing at multiple layers of the cyber-physical systems including robust\
        \ and resilient control, secure network routing and management of information\
        \ security and smart grid energy systems. &#13;\n&#13;\nHybrid distributed\
        \ reinforcement learning algorithms are developed as practical modeling tools\
        \ for defense systems with different levels of rationality and intelligence\
        \ at different times. The learning algorithms enable online computations of\
        \ defense strategies, such as routing decisions and configuration policies,\
        \ for nonzero-sum security games with incomplete information. In addition,\
        \ games-in-games frameworks are proposed for system-wide modeling of complex\
        \ hierarchical systems, where games played at different levels interact through\
        \ their outcomes, action spaces, and costs. This concept is applied to robust\
        \ and resilient control of power systems in which a zero-sum differential\
        \ game for physical robust control design is nested in and coupled with a\
        \ zero-sum stochastic game for security policy design. &#13;\n&#13;\nAt the\
        \ networking layer of the system, multi-hop secure routing games also exhibit\
        \ the games-in-games structure, and their equilibrium solutions are characterized\
        \ by backward induction solving a sequence of nested games. This approach\
        \ leads to a distributed secure routing protocol that enables the resilience\
        \ of network routing and self-recovery mechanisms in face of adversarial attacks.\
        \ &#13;\n&#13;\nFinally,  in order to address emerging energy management issues\
        \ of the smart grid, we establish a fundamental game-theoretic framework for\
        \ analyzing system equilibrium under distributed generations, renewable energy\
        \ sources and active participation of utility users. Furthermore, we develop\
        \ a novel game framework and its equilibrium solution, named mirror Stackelberg\
        \ equilibrium, for modeling the demand response management in the smart grid.\
        \ This approach enables quantitative study of the value of demand response\
        \ brought by emerging smart grid technologies as compared to the current supply-side\
        \ economic dispatch model. It facilitates fundamental understanding of pricing,\
        \ energy policies and infrastructural investment decision in future highly\
        \ interconnected and interdependent energy systems. Examples from power systems,\
        \ cognitive radio communication networks, and the smart grid are used as driving\
        \ examples for illustrating new solution concepts, distributed algorithms\
        \ and analytical techniques presented in this dissertation.</dc:description>\n\

        \ adults, the relationship between specific contextual factors and peer interactions,\
        \ and the informal roles students with severe disabilities assume during inclusive\

        \ and focus groups of preservice teachers who facilitated the service-learning\

        \ The findings indicate that students with severe disabilities had interactions\
        \ with peers during inclusive service-learning that ranged in frequency and\
        \ ease from natural to challenging; the majority of interactions were task\
        \ related; adults and peers had positive perceptions of group functioning;\
        \ and adult interactions occurred primarily within the function of providing\
        \ supports. All of the contextual factors examined were each found to be associated\
        \ with peer interactions. Students with severe disabilities assumed a variety\
        \ of roles that fell within the three categories described in the literature:\
        \ group building roles, task completion roles, and individualistic roles.\
        \ An additional role category, neutral roles, emerged through the qualitative\
        \ analysis. Recommendations for future investigations and inclusive service-learning\
        \ practice are also presented.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2014-05-30T16:40:17Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ about transnational aspects of the Victorian era from the vantage point\
        \ of what Paul Gilroy described more than two decades ago as the ???black\
        \ Atlantic.???  Looking at various ways in which the black Atlantic was at\
        \ times a British Atlantic, my dissertation aims to complicate a flow of discussion\
        \ that Gilroy???s Americanist successors have interpreted largely in light\
        \ of U.S. slavery and its discursive contexts.  Specifically, I explore how\
        \ some nineteenth-century British authors such as Jane Austen, Elizabeth Barrett\
        \ Browning, Mary Seacole, and Wilkie Collins rejected popular notions of blackness\
        \ as a racial marker of African slavery with its implied negative qualities.\
        \  Instead, their works convey a different idea about blackness as a pliable\
        \ marker of cultural agency that not only constitutes a part of English culture,\
        \ but is performed by people regardless of racial affiliation.  This notion\
        \ of blackness as performative signifier goes beyond the slavery metaphor\
        \ in Victorian literature to frame an interpretive paradigm that allows us\
        \ to read blackness in broader socio-political contexts.  As I show how canonical\
        \ and non-canonical nineteenth-century British literature used various kinds\
        \ of black performativity to undo essentialist notions of blackness, race,\
        \ and identity itself, I demonstrate the integral status of blackness in Victorian\
        \ literature.  This in turn points to nineteenth-century English culture not\
        \ as an isolated entity that imposed itself on Africans and on slave-owning\
        \ colonies of the British Empire, but as participant in a larger cultural\
        \ network called the black Atlantic.  The black Atlantic thus invites us to\
        \ revise British literature and culture by questioning the assumed homogeneity\
        \ of white-centrism and even the stability of whiteness itself as foundational\
        \ for English identity.&#13;\n&#13;\nIn the first chapter, I look at how Jane\
        \ Austen???s Mansfield Park (1814) and Persuasion (1818) engage blackness\
        \ without featuring a single black or mixed-race character.  Reading this\
        \ absence as literary strategy, I argue that the two novels reject the popular\
        \ view of blackness as too restrictively applied to oppression and marginalization,\
        \ and associate it instead with women???s autonomy and social participation\
        \ in an era of heightened debate over slavery following the 1807 Slave Trade\
        \ Act.  Here blackness comes to represent an ethically viable form of women???s\
        \ autonomy that doesn???t necessarily unsettle the established social order\
        \ even as it challenges the mercantile logic of sexual hierarchy represented\
        \ by the corrupt marriage market.  In fact, by validating women???s autonomy\
        \ in the context of middle-class ethics, Austen suggests that such autonomy\
        \ is a prerequisite of social stability.&#13;\n&#13;\nChapter two explores\
        \ how Elizabeth Barrett Browning???s three antislavery poems??????The Runaway\
        \ Slave at Pilgrim???s Point??? (1847/1848), ???Hiram Powers??? Greek Slave???\
        \ (1850), and ???A Curse for a Nation??? (1855/1866)???extend beyond the issue\
        \ of American slavery to address British racism.  Representing blackness as\
        \ a signifier of artistic creativity, the poems aesthetically challenge essentialist\
        \ notions of black inferiority in a mid-Victorian society troubled by post-abolition\
        \ economic decline and colonial unrest in the British West Indies.  EBB???s\
        \ antislavery poems thus work to liberate blackness from the chains of racial\
        \ essentialism and draw on black performativity to expand the language of\
        \ the poet???s social criticism.&#13;\n&#13;\nChapter three investigates Mary\
        \ Seacole???s performative identity in her travel narrative, Wonderful Adventures\
        \ of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands (1857).  Knowing her Victorian readers will\
        \ be predisposed to read her mixed-race body as a marker of otherness, Seacole\
        \ plays with their belief in ways that de-essentialize race:  first, she disrupts\
        \ whiteness as a racial signifier ontologically grounded in skin color by\
        \ portraying her successful performance of the idealized English mother in\
        \ the Crimea.  Seacole then represents her physical ???blackness??? as a marker\
        \ of life-saving hybrid medicine, a cultural signifier that revises racist\
        \ notions of identity.  In the process, she exposes Englishness as an unstable\
        \ marker of identity that can be performed by people of different races.&#13;\n\
        &#13;\nChapter four considers how Wilkie Collins problematizes binaristic\
        \ notions of race in Armadale (1866), Miss or Mrs? (1873), and The Guilty\
        \ River (1886).  Collins???s radical reevaluations of racial others vis-??-vis\
        \ Englishness and Britishness come at a time when a series of colonial uprisings\
        \ like the Indian ???Mutiny??? and the Morant Bay rebellion exacerbated the\
        \ growing acceptance of permanent racial hierarchies (as opposed to the older\
        \ notion of eventual human universality).  Armadale emphasizes blackness as\
        \ a marker of sympathy???the essential element of English morality seldom\
        \ seen in the author???s time.  Affirming blackness as the moral essence of\
        \ Englishness, Miss or Mrs? and The Guilty River reflect Collins???s growing\
        \ frustration with the way a kind of binaristic thinking he challenged in\
        \ Armadale continued to thrive in English society.  These texts ultimately\
        \ call for understanding English identity as an ongoing expression of inter-racial,\
        \ inter-cultural reciprocity.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2014-05-30T17:19:29Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>The purpose of this study was to investigate the functions,\
        \ language choice, developmental changes, and cognitive and social contexts\
        \ of private speech for an initially monolingual Chinese--subsequently bilingual\
        \ Chinese-English--child in natural settings. Data were collected through\
        \ naturalistic videotaping of the child in nursery school and kindergarten\
        \ for two years, using a radio microphone. Private utterances were identified,\
        \ and their functional category, language choice, cognitive context, and social\
        \ context were coded for statistical analysis. Intensive observation of the\
        \ subject in school and at home, and interviews with him and his parents provided\
        \ additional qualitative information.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Results\
        \ indicated that private speech in natural settings displayed a greater variety\
        \ of functional types than has been reported in experimental studies. A curvilinear\
        \ developmental trend was found for the total amount of private speech, supporting\
        \ Vygotsky's hypothesis. Linear increase in the category of incomprehensible/inaudible\
        \ supported Vygotsky's contention that private speech &amp;quot;goes underground&amp;quot;\
        \ to form inner speech. Vygotsky's hypothesis that self-direction would occur\
        \ more frequently in cognitively demanding than in cognitively undemanding\
        \ contexts was not confirmed. The small proportion of private speech produced\
        \ that was strictly self-regulatory in nature ran counter to Vygotsky's claim\
        \ that self-regulation is the primary function of private speech. Both L1\
        \ (native language) and L2 (second language) were used for all the functions\
        \ examined in this study, with a gradual shift to L2 in most of the functions.\
        \ The language choice in private speech was not correlated with the language\
        \ spoken by others around at the onset of second language learning, and indeed\
        \ was somewhat negatively related, suggesting that the child did not wish\
        \ others to overhear him. As bilingual competence developed, the correlation\
        \ increased dramatically near L2 speakers, and finally, the language of the\
        \ setting was adopted almost entirely. Intensive observation suggested that\
        \ physical settings, nature of activities, social relationships, and feelings\
        \ about the setting had influence on the production of private speech. Naturalistic\
        \ methodology is recommended for additional future research on private speech.</dc:description>\n\

        \ that: (a) Korean and English were different in the temporal variables concerning\
        \ verbalization rate (speech rate, articulation rate, and mean length of runs),\

        \ and (b) the inferior rate of information output in children's and non-native\

        <dc:description>277 p.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Thesis (Ph.D.)--University\
        \ of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1987.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The\
        \ purpose of the dissertation is to argue for a change in the traditional\
        \ approach to Greek drama and athletics: rather than viewing drama and athletics\
        \ as essentially unrelated, it is preferable to consider each activity in\
        \ the light of its relationship with the other.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Chapter\
        \ one discusses the festival context in which both drama and athletics operate\
        \ and shows that the conditions of performance are basically the same: dramatic\
        \ and athletic victors receive similar prizes and have their victories recorded\
        \ side by side. The rigid separation of athletic and dramatic/musical performances\
        \ is artificial; the pyrrich dance, for instance, defies classification under\
        \ the traditional headings.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Chapter two\
        \ examines the element of conflict, the agon, which is at the root of both\
        \ athletic and dramatic spectacles. The structures of both kinds of performance\
        \ are similar and four basic analogies are proposed: (1) poet: athlete; (2)\
        \ dramatic competition: athletic contest; (3) character in drama: athlete;\
        \ (4) dramatic conflict: athletic contest.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Chapter\
        \ three focuses on the texts of Greek tragedy and comedy. Athletic terminology\
        \ and imagery are very common in most extant plays. Words to do with conflict\
        \ (the agon), victory, wrestling and running are the most frequently used.</dc:description>\n\

        \ of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1993.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>This\
        \ thesis involves the development of network and load models for power system\
        \ analysis. Traditional power system models consist of detailed generator\
        \ models and simple network and load models. In the past this has been acceptable\
        \ as these models captured observed phenomena. These models do not sufficiently\
        \ describe the system under heavily loaded conditions; in fact, the mathematical\
        \ equations may not exhibit a solution. This is unacceptable. The problem\
        \ is that the form of traditional load models is chosen for convenience and\
        \ is not based on actual load dynamics. In this thesis, network and load models\
        \ are presented that capture important frequency and voltage dependencies.\
        \ Conditions on a common class of static load models are given to ensure that\
        \ the power system algebraic equations will exhibit a solution. An induction\
        \ motor model is used to justify dynamic load models that appear in the literature\
        \ and to develop new models. These models are important because they are based\
        \ on physical motor characteristics. Steady-state, transient, and structural\
        \ stability studies are performed to examine the effects of different static\
        \ and induction motor loads.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2014-12-16T22:23:07Z</dc:date>\n\
