        Abstract: In the last 15 years, the necessity to put together knowledge from
        different expertise areas placed the fusion centers that provide analysis
        and evaluation in various specific fields in the middle of intelligence organizations''
        strategic plans and visions. The inclusion of academia, universities, research
        centers, and business sector in the intelligence process has become a sine
        qua non condition of the intelligence workflow, especially on the strategic
        level.This paper consists in a short evaluation of the existing models and
        presents the so-called analytical hubs as proposal for an integrative working
        model. OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) plays an important role within these
        collaborative platforms as the most appropriate resource to introduce and
        use outside expertise into the intelligence system and to inform the beneficiaries
        in order to adopt the best decisions to promote the national interest.</description><pubDate>Mon,

        the Case Law from a Comparative Family Law Perspective</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626903</link><description>The
        aim of this paper is the analysis of gender stereotypes in family case law,
        especially to the traditional gender roles: male-female, husband-wife, father-mother.
        Indeed, analyzing the grounds of the judgments in an area with a strong influence
        of political, philosophical, religious and social issues as family law, we
        find that stereotypes, especially gender stereotypes, could hide themselves
        behind apparently neutral concepts. But what is a &#8220;stereotype&#8221;?
        Especially a &#8220;gender stereotype&#8221;? It concerns the sex of a person,
        especially his or her failure to conform with socially accepted sexual behaviour
        about what &#8220;real&#8221; men or women do or don''t do.For instance in
        civil law systems themselves, such as in France, nowadays, the ideology related
        to the juge est-il la bouche de la loi, implemented during the French Revolution,
        justifies the synthetic model of French judgments, showing only hints of the
        facts of the case and the legal reasoning of the judge. On the contrary, in
        Germany, according to the systematic and phylosophical tradition, judges often
        describe the complexity of their logical and juridical reasoning. In the Common
        Law System in the case law method the &#8220;direct presence of facts distinguishes
        reasoning with previous decisions in the "classical" common law context from
        reasoning statutes or the constitution&#8221;, furthermore judges have to
        detail each logical step according to the distinguishing principle. According
        to this pattern of judgments it is possible to find gender stereotypes in
        the legal reasoning because the pattern of decisions allows judges to express
        their own opinions in &#8220;rainbow families&#8221; cases.</description><pubDate>Mon,

        Interactions in Explaining the Performance of Public Sector Enterprises in
        India: The Disinvestment Experience</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2623883</link><description>India
        had adopted disinvestment, as part of broader reforms, in 1991 to improve
        performance of public sector enterprises (PSEs) owned by the Central government
        of India. The current study captures the effect of disinvestment policy on
        the performance of PSEs with special emphasis on the local political and economic
        environments in which these enterprises operate. Using firm efficiency to
        capture performance of all PSEs owned by the central government between 1991-92-2010-11,
        the study employs panel data fixed effects and two stage least square estimation.
        The results suggest that performance of PSEs is driven by a harmonious union
        of internal (firm specific) and external factors. Among external factors,
        disinvestment, as a policy intervention, has a limited impact on performance
        where as state specific political and economic factors affect firm performance
        strongly. Finally, the effect of disinvestment on firm performance is conditioned
        by the political factors in the state where the PSE is located.</description><pubDate>Mon,

        gli investimenti: potenzialit&#224; e problemi dell&#8217;implementazione
        (The Juncker Plan for Investments: Opportunities and Challenges of the Implementation)</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2623974</link><description>Italian
        Abstract: La crisi economica ha prodotto un calo di investimenti in Europa
        del 15% rispetto ai livelli pre-crisi, con effetti particolarmente pesanti
        sui paesi alla &#8220;periferia&#8221; dell&#8217;Eurozona. Per rilanciare
        la crescita la Commissione Juncker ha lanciato un piano per mobilitare 315
        miliardi di Euro in investimenti produttivi utilizzando un sistema di leve
        finanziarie gestite dalla Banca Europea degli Investimenti.  Per quanto di
        per se non sufficiente a rilanciare la crescita, nel contesto dell&#8217;attuale
        riforma della governance economica dell&#8217;Europa, il &#8220;Piano Juncker&#8221;
        va nella giusta direzione di fornire una risposta aggregata a livello europeo
        alla mancanza di investimenti, fornendo risorse a progetti &#8220;bancabili&#8221;
        anche in paesi dove il mercato &#232; avverso al rischio.Poich&#233; questo
        piano non crea nuove risorse, il suo successo dipender&#224; non tanto dalla
        quantit&#224; di risorse mobilitate (il target di 315 miliardi &#232; raggiungibile)
        ma dalla qualit&#224; della finanza offerta. Il programma di Quantitative
        Easing lanciato dalla BCE sta fornendo abbondante liquidit&#224; ai mercati.
        Il &#8220;Piano Juncker&#8221; &#232; uno strumento per canalizzare queste
        risorse verso investimenti strategici.L&#8217;obiettivo del Piano deve essere
        duplice: contribuire a completare il mercato unico e finanziare/orientare
        l&#8217;innovazione delle imprese con strumenti finanziari innovativi. Il
        successo del Piano dipender&#224; in ultima analisi dalla capacit&#224; della
        BEI e degli Stati Membri di implementare gli strumenti finanziari introdotti
        (in particolare quelli di equity e rivolti alle PMI) in tempi ristretti, creando
        sinergie con le Banche di Promozione Nazionali e addizionalit&#224; rispetto
        agli investitori privati.English Abstract: The economic crisis has resulted
        a 15% fall in investments in Europe compared to pre-crisis levels. Its effects
        were particularly heavy on the countries at the "periphery" of the Eurozone.
        To boost economic growth, the Juncker Commission launched a plan to mobilize
        315 billion Euro towards productive investments through a system of financial
        leverages managed by the European Investment Bank (EIB). This will not be
        sufficient in itself to reignite economic growth but, in the context of the
        ongoing reform of European economic governance, the "Plan Juncker" goes in
        the right direction. It responds to the lack of investments with an aggregated
        European instrument that provides resources to "bankable" projects that may
        be based in countries where markets are excessively risk averse.Since this
        plan does not "create" new resources, its success will depend not so much
        on the amount of resources it mobilizes (the target of 315 billion is reached)
        but on the quality of the finance it offers. The Quantitative Easing program
        launched by the ECB is providing ample liquidity to markets. The "Juncker
        Plan" provides a tool to channel these resources towards strategic investments.The
        objective of the plan must be twofold: to help complete the European single
        market and to finance/orient private sector innovation with the help of a
        new generation of financial instruments. The success of the plan will ultimately
        depend on the capacity of the EIB and the Member States to implement the financial
        instruments that have been introduced (in particular on equity financing and
        SMEs) within a short time-frame, creating synergies with the National Promotion
        Banks and "additionallity" vis-&#224;-vis private investors.</description><pubDate>Mon,

        - An Indian Comparative Legal Analysis</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625608</link><description>The
        2001 census of India shows the number of married couples to be 173,044,576.  Due
        to the change in the lifestyle and the pattern of living in today&#8217;s
        times, the number of couples who have various medical problems in conceiving
        has risen tremendously. The recent National Family Health Survey, for example,
        estimates childlessness as 2.4 percent of currently married women over 40
        in India, one in every six couples being infertile.These people, including
        other couples who may not have had children due to other reasons, then resort
        to other measures like adopting a child, surrogacy, etc.Though these methods
        are a boon to many couples across the country, however there exist several
        lacunae with respect to their implementation. There are numerous hindrances
        that people may have to face like increased costs, difference in various personal
        laws, etc. The latter is a common problem that is faced in India due to the
        divergence in adoption and other laws across various religions practiced in
        the country.This paper is thus a humble attempt to provide a comparative analysis
        of these two above mentioned options i.e adoption and surrogacy with respect
        to India and discuss the several aspects with reference to feasibility, cost
        etc. Last but not the least, the legal provisions highlighting the lacunae
        with respect to various personal laws would also be dealt with in detail.</description><pubDate>Mon,

        and Consumer Rights: Applicability of Consumer Protection Laws in Online Transactions
        in India</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626027</link><description>In
        a business ecosystem, consumers are the most vital elements. A business is
        not reviewed in isolation but is always considered in a combination with the
        consumers of its good and services. Given such high level of importance that
        a consumer has in a business network, it is a matter of great shame that their
        consumer rights are not protected due to non-availability of effective and
        stringent laws and the ineffectual redressal mechanisms, specially in  e-commerce
        or online transactions.Though e-commerce has enabled the Indian consumer to
        cross boundaries of states and countries to procure products of their choice,
        this increased scope for purchase and sale transactions brought about by e-commerce
        is not well protected by the various Indian consumer laws. The laws with respect
        to the same have proved to be stagnant, leaving many of such customers remediless.
        Non protection of data made available online, ineffective delivery system,
        misleading advertisements, uncertainty with respect to  jurisdiction in case
        of disputes, are some of the emerging concerns in the field of e-commerce.
        In the light of the above, this article would in brief, look through the lens
        on rights which a consumer has in case of online transactions, keeping in
        background the various Indian consumer laws available namely the Consumer
        Protection Act, 1986, the Information Technology Act, 2000, the Competition
        Act, 2000, the Indian Contract Act etc. Recommendations and measures for removal
        of such lacunae as present in the Indian consumer laws have also been covered.</description><pubDate>Mon,

        Attempting to Make a Collage from an Incoherent Framework</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626490</link><description>In
        June 2015, President Al-Bashir of Sudan attended the African Union (hereinafter
        &#8216;AU&#8217;) Summit hosted in South Africa.  The result was a Court process
        that revealed the legal complexities surrounding the execution of the arrest
        warrant issued against Al-Bashir.  With Bashir&#8217;s attendance of the Summit,
        the potential conflict of obligations that arise as a result of the arrest
        warrant became real for South Africa. The aftermath &#8211; although I hasten
        to add that the full repercussions will continue to unfold &#8211; of the
        circumstances of Al-Bashir&#8217;s arrival in and departure from South Africa,
        without being arrested by South African authorities, was a judgment by the
        North Gauteng High Court (hereinafter the &#8216;NGHC&#8217;) determining
        that there was a duty to arrest Al-Bashir and to surrender him to the International
        Criminal Court (hereinafter the &#8216;ICC&#8217;).</description><pubDate>Sun,

        in Consumer Payments: Updates from the Visa Payment Panel Study</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626502</link><description>Michael
        Marx, senior director, Visa Research Insights, conducted a workshop in 2009
        at the Payment Cards Center (PCC) as the economy was emerging from a recession.
        At that time, it appeared that the recession had affected consumer payment
        preferences, especially those related to cash and credit cards. To get an
        update on consumers&#8217; use of the various payment methods, the PCC invited
        Marx to facilitate another workshop in 2014. More recent findings from the
        Visa Payment Panel Study reveal declines in cash use &#8213; a return to the
        long-term trend &#8213; and increases in credit card use, perhaps signaling
        some return of confidence among consumers. Check use continued its unbroken
        long-term decline, and debit card growth has slowed. Private label cards have
        also registered a steady decline in their share of spending volume for a number
        of years. Their revolving credit utility, however, remains consequential in
        financing consumer purchases.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2015 12:53:03

        set of initial weights, the adaptive Lasso selects the relevant variables
        with probability converging to one. Afterwards, we show that the estimator
        is oracle, meaning that its distribution converges to the same distribution
        of the oracle assisted least squares, i.e., the least squares estimator calculated
        as if we knew the set of relevant variables beforehand. Finally, we show that

        downward-sloping term structure of equity and upward-sloping term structures
        of interest rates arise endogenously in a general-equilibrium model with nominal
        rigidities and nonlinear habits in consumption. Countercyclical marginal costs
        exacerbate the procyclicality of dividends after a technology shock, and hence
        their riskiness, and generate countercyclical inflation. Marginal costs gradually
        fall after a negative technology shock as the price level increases sluggishly,
        so the payoffs of short-duration dividend claims (bonds) are more (less) procyclical
        than the payoffs of long-duration claims (bonds). The simultaneous presence
        of market and home consumption habits allows for uniting nonlinear habits
        and a production economy without compromising the ability of the model to
        fit macroeconomic variables.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2015 12:53:10

        A Short Bayesian Answer</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626624</link><description>The
        properties of information, including "information uncertainty", can be understood
        only Bayesianly. Common formulations that define information uncertainty in
        terms of just statistical "precision" (i.e. sampling variance), or any one
        estimator characteristic (e.g. bias), are inadequate for generalized Bayesian
        analysis. Methods that deny information a Bayesian characterization are bound
        to yield Bayesianly incorrect generalizations. In the Bayesian way of thinking,
        information risk impacts the likelihood function f(x|&#966;,&#8901;), which
        captures the subjective strengths and weaknesses of signal x with respect
        to unknown &#966;. By affecting f(x|&#966;,&#8901;), information uncertainty
        alters posterior beliefs f(&#966;|x,&#8901;), and therefore also asset prices
        and expected rates of return. Less obviously, formal Bayesian allowance for
        information uncertainty can lead to unexpected reinterpretations of information,
        which can reduce (or increase) the cost of capital. A striking example is
        shown based on Simpson''s paradox</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2015 12:53:03

        Evolution</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626628</link><description>Prior
        to the first Millennium BCE, introspection and reflexive thought were essentially
        absent from literary texts. At approximately the middle of the first millennium
        BCE, introspection and reflexive thought began to emerge. This period has
        been identified as the "Axial Age". In this paper I attempt to track this
        change using techniques derived from computational linguistics. Specifically,
        I use the variable Cogmech (cognitive mechanisms) from Linguistic Inquiry
        and Word Count (LIWC) to measure the extent to which there were changes in
        cognitive elements of expression used in literary works written in the period
        from 2000 BCE to the modern era. The evidence is that Cogmech rises significantly
        at approximately 650 BCE and remains at this level with minor variations up
        to the modern era, thus supporting the Axial Age hypothesis</description><pubDate>Mon,

        Capital Flows</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626635</link><description>In
        a large panel of 26 emerging countries over the last 40 years, stock market
        return volatilities forecast capital flows. When a country&#8217;s stock market
        volatility increases, capital inflows decrease and capital outflows increase,
        with net flows slightly decreasing. We study one potential explanation for
        these results: expropriation risk. Empirically, we find that volatility forecasts
        political risk, and that political risk significantly affects capital flows.
        In a simple portfolio choice model, assuming that foreigners are more exposed
        to expropriation risk than local investors, an increase in the probability
        of expropriation leads foreigners to sell the domestic assets to the local
        investors, leading to a counter-cyclical home bias. This coincides with higher
        price volatility under plausible assumptions.</description><pubDate>Sun, 05

        Risk Preferences in Thrifts</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626642</link><description>We
        examine institutions&#8217; revealed preferences towards default risk in publicly
        traded savings and loan institutions (S&amp;Ls; or thrifts). We test whether
        institutions consider default risks to be fairly priced, and therefore do
        not mind holding thrifts exposed to it. Our tests avoid the problems associated
        with measuring risks and returns ex-ante versus ex-post. An important underlying
        assumption of the distress anomaly is that financially distressed firms tend
        to cluster, preventing investors from diversifying away their risks. During
        the two financial crises, thrifts clearly met this criteria. We find statistically
        significant evidence for an inverse relationship between institutional ownership
        and thrift default risk. We also find statistically significant evidence that
        institutions increase ownership during financial crises. Our results hold
        for fixed effects and three stage least squares (3SLS) regressions as robustness
        tests to deal with missing variable bias and endogeneity between default risk
        and institutional ownership.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2015 12:53:23

        Models with Nonlinear Habits</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626644</link><description>We
        propose a first-order approximation technique to price assets in closed form
        in Gaussian dynamic macro-finance models with nonlinear habit formation. We
        use the technique to approximately solve the benchmark external habit models
        of Campbell and Cochrane [1999. Journal of Political Economy 107, 205-51]
        and Wachter [2006. A consumption-based model of the term structure of interest
        rates. Journal of Financial Economics 79, 365-99] as well as a more complex
        version that features a production economy and nominal rigidities. To compare
        the approximate solution with the numerical solution we report the term structures
        of equity and bond yields, which capture the quality of the approximation
        at different time horizons and a major diagnostic decomposition. The proposed
        exponential-affine approximation performs similarly to numerical solution
        methods and outperforms alternative loglinear-lognormal approximation methods.</description><pubDate>Mon,

        paper addresses the Chilean business research production in Web of Science-WOS
        (ISI articles) in the last 25 years (1988-2012). 453 research pieces appear
        in the database in three business related WOS categories: &#8220;business,&#8221;
        &#8220;management&#8221; and &#8220;business and finance.&#8221; Chilean business
        research production represents a larger percentage of Latin American research
        (16%), compared to other Social Sciences (9,6%) and All Sciences (8,2%), and
        is the leading country in the region for papers per capita. Chilean business
        research has grown over time, experiencing even higher growth in the last
        5 years. The inclusion of 6 new Latin American business journals in WOS partially
        explains this trend. Research collaboration has increased over time (larger

        it is a much more flexible instrument than class-size reduction. We find substantial

        Do Really Judges Punish? Judicial Selection of Appropriate Imprisonment Terms.</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626679</link><description>Criminal
        codes provide judges with a freedom to impose a proper punishment on offenders.
        This article investigates how judges use this freedom of choice in determining
        the appropriate imprisonment terms for most common crimes. The analysis is
        based on all 504,281 final sentences given in 2005 in Poland in criminal cases.It
        has been found that judges punish criminals in a very schematic way. Judges
        select only few terms of imprisonment from the applicable range and ignore
        all other possibilities, which casts doubt on whether punishment really fits
        the crime. In fact, the 5 most commonly used terms of imprisonment constitute
        between 60 and 90 % of all sentences. There would be small difference then
        if instead of a continuum of imprisonment terms, the criminal code provided
        only 5 possible terms of imprisonment for a given crime. Moreover, in choosing
        the length of a sentence, judges have a particular tendency to use mostly
        even numbers, in particular multiplies of 6 and 12 months. Judges do not use
        odd numbers, with an exception of multiplies of 3 months. Therefore, even
        if the culpability of the offender depends on many factors of continuous characteristics
        (like his motivation and modus operandi, the nature and size of the harm done
        by crime, a way of life before the offense, the behaviour after the commission
        of crime and so on), discontinuity of the penalties&#8217; distribution suggests
        that some offenders are punished unjust &#8211; either too severely or too
        leniently, due to schematic way of judicial assessment.The further analysis
        of the 25 most commonly punished crimes reveals that courts do not use the
        whole available range of punishment as provided for in criminal law. Judges
        punish offenders by imprisonment terms close to the lower limit of applicable
        penalty (anchor point), and they rarely exceed 50% of the applicable range.
        Therefore, more severe punishments provided for in the criminal code remain
        rather a theoretical threat.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2015 12:53:42

        1991 International Convention for the Protection of New Plant Varieties (UPOV
        1991) provides for a breeder&#8217;s exemption allowing the protected plant
        variety to be used to breed new varieties. The United Nations Convention on

        and details an obligation to share any benefits. This article shows that while
        the CBD and Nagoya Protocol and UPOV 1991 operate separately, in their implementation
        in domestic laws the CBD/Nagoya Protocol access and benefit-sharing contracts
        can limit the UPOV 1991&#8217;s breeder&#8217;s exemption, restricting further

        GWAS, SNPs and Patents</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626691</link><description>This
        article reviews the problems posed by patent claims to genetic diagnostic
        methods associated with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) adopting methodologies
        using next generation sequencing (NGS) and single nucleotide polymorphism
        (SNP). These problems are essentially about experimental reproducibility and
        the credibility and veracity of reported developments. An analysis of the
        relevant law demonstrates that the current Australian and United States laws
        about suitable patentable subject matter differ, and that the current reproducibility
        (sufficiency, enablement and inutility) standards are unlikely to address
        these problems. The article concludes that following the United States approach
        excluding these genetic diagnostic method claims from patenting is one solution.
        Failing this, improving analysis and quality controls that are now being adopted
        in the basic research will reduce the nature of the problems, although this
        will remain problematic for patent examiners and the broader public.</description><pubDate>Mon,

        four-factor model with two &#8220;mispricing&#8221; factors, in addition to
        market and size factors, accommodates a large set of anomalies better than
        notable four- and five-factor alternative models. Moreover, our size factor
        reveals a small-firm premium nearly twice usual estimates. The mispricing
        factors aggregate information across 11 prominent anomalies by averaging rankings
        within two clusters exhibiting the greatest co-movement in long-short returns.
        Investor sentiment predicts the mispricing factors, especially their short
        legs, consistent with a mispricing interpretation and the asymmetry in ease
        of buying versus shorting. Replacing book-to-market with a single composite
        mispricing factor produces a better-performing three-factor model.</description><pubDate>Mon,

        of School Consolidation on Student Achievement: Evidence of Disruption?</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626712</link><description>We
        exploit exogenous variation stemming from school consolidations in Denmark
        from 2010-2011 to analyze the impact on student achievement as measured by
        test scores in grades 4 and 6. We find that school consolidation generally
        has adverse effects on student achievement in the short run and that these
        adverse effects are most pronounced for students exposed to school closings.
        The effects appear to weaken over time, suggesting that at least part of the
        effect is due to disruption. We consider two main channels, school size and
        peer composition, to explore how consolidation may affect achievement due
        to changes in the quality of the school. These channels are examined using
        a two-stage least squares regression analysis in which we instrument the changes
        in school quality by the predicted changes in school quality following a school
        consolidation. The results suggest that school size has a negative effect

        extent to which China is an innovative economy is the topic of ongoing contention
        in scholarly and practitioner circles. The intellectual property component
        of China&#8217;s technological catch-up strategy has been geared towards first
        focusing on quantity of outputs and then eventually shifting towards ensuring
        the quality of outputs. Disconcertingly, in recent years this strategy has
        created negative impacts on patent quality and thus somewhat may have hampered
        innovation in China.New Chinese intellectual property policies, and the 2014
        phenomena of decreasing annual growth rates of domestic invention patent filings
        and unprecedented negative growth rates of domestic utility model and design
        filings, shed new light on this debate. They suggest that recent shifts away
        from the government strategy of stimulating mere numbers of any type of patent
        application may be having a tangible impact. Even though science &amp; technology
        development in China will inevitably continue to be a numbers game of sorts,
        these recent trends may reflect a step towards a healthier Chinese innovation
        trajectory. Scholars, policymakers, and businesses should consider these shifting
        dynamics in their intellectual property and innovation forecasting, strategizing,
        and planning.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2015 12:53:52 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Epistemic

        the increasing density of communication networks and the diminishing importance
        of national boundaries for the flow of commodities, capital, workers, information

        and processing organisations increasingly structure society. The old question
        of classical sociology, initiated by Karl Marx and Max Weber, whether the
        relations of production or rather knowledge and the spirit of capitalism determine
        economy and society seems to have been settled once and for all in favour
        of the Weberian position. Knowledge governs economy and society. But now this
        process appears to reach a new stage, not thought of by Scheler, where Sein

        Update 2015 &#8211; Return Differences and Exchange Rate Movements</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626725</link><description>We
        update our annual analysis of expected returns for 38 equity markets around
        the world. For the first time since we started our series in 2012, we find
        most emerging markets now exhibit higher expected returns than developed markets.
        In particular the expected returns for the core European stock markets of
        Germany, the UK and Switzerland have declined after strong performances of
        2014 and early 2015. For many of these markets, expected returns are now at
        or below historical averages, but still significantly above the mediocre returns
        expected for the US stock market.In this study we examine the significant
        differences between expected returns in different countries. We demonstrate
        that exchange rate movements exert a considerable influence on stock market
        returns. Contrary to common belief, exchange rate movements also matter for
        longer investment horizons of, say, five to ten years. We show how stock market
        valuation differences correlate with exchange rate movements, and perhaps
        surprisingly we show that CAPE differences between two countries offer some
        insight into their long-term exchange rate trends. One likely outcome of our
        analysis is that over the next five years European stock markets will likely
        show higher returns in euros than do US markets in dollars. We would quickly
        add that exchange rate movements may reduce the effective return difference
        when calculated in a common currency such as the euro or the dollar. Thus,
        to reap the full benefits of a global equity investment strategy, US investors
        should use currency-hedged investments to avoid losses from devalued foreign
        currencies.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2015 12:53:23 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Las

        Diets: Shopping Frequency and Food Choice</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626738</link><description>From
        1998 to 2009 I find that the average time between U.S. households&#8217; grocery
        shopping trips has steadily increased from 4.7 to 6.2 days, and from 1998
        to 2006 per capita monthly consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables has
        decreased from 130 to 112 oz.  To understand these changes, a dynamic model
        is developed of a resource constrained consumer optimally choosing the timing
        and quantity of discrete purchases, and piecewise continuous consumption paths
        of a perishable good.  When calibrated to U.S. national average data, the
        model is found to be in close agreement, and rationalizes the observed drops
        in fresh produce and shopping frequency.  A household fixed effects model
        confirms that shopping frequency and fresh produce consumption are causally
        linked.  Of food retail environmental factors tested using a household level
        random effects model, the presence of supercenters and club stores have the
        largest impact on shopping frequency and fresh produce consumption.  Impacts
        are decomposed into direct effects and effects mediated through shopping frequency.  Nutritive
        aspects of food perishability are discussed and it is hypothesized that shopping
        frequency and many diet-based diseases are interrelated as households optimally
        manage their food inventory.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2015 12:53:03

        of Expertise in Legal Process</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626747</link><description>The
        application of medical expertise within a legal context presents a number
        of difficulties that demand consideration if the courts are to continue to
        rely upon complex medico-scientific evidence in criminal cases. Using examples
        from England and Wales, this article examines how miscarriages of justice
        have systematically resulted from the expert testimonies of paediatric forensic
        pathologists in criminal cases involving Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
        Although there are regulatory bodies in place to ensure that forensic pathologists
        conduct themselves professionally, we argue that the courts must also recognize
        the intrinsic limits to their expertise. Paediatric forensic pathologists
        are &#8216;gate-keepers&#8217; who determine how medical and legal institutions
        will deal with child fatalities when the cause of death is suspicious or unascertained.
        Over the course of their infant death investigations, paediatric forensic
        pathologists will make what are often subjective interpretations of complex
        data concerning the child&#8217;s medical, social, and familial histories.
        Such interpretation is open to dispute, so over-reliance upon a particular
        expert witness increases the likelihood that a verdict will be declared unsafe
        upon review. Comparisons will be made to the recent province of Ontario experience
        with the Goudge Commission of Inquiry into Paediatric Forensic Pathology and
        its subsequent recommendations.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2015 12:53:42

        for Packaged Products: An Empirical Study in a Chilean Hypermarket</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626754</link><description>Understanding
        variations in shopper price knowledge is important to academics identifying
        their sources, and to retail managers whose pricing strategies may depend
        on the extent of shopper price knowledge (or lack of) within the items they
        manage, since price knowledge is an important driver of item choice. This
        paper examines the influence of product and shopper factors on shoppers&#8217;
        in-store price knowledge for packaged food products in a sample of 585 shoppers
        in a Chilean hypermarket. Shopper self-report of price-comparison activity,
        non-purchase of bundle products (packs), in-store and out-store price signs,
        and item''s price show positive correlations with consumers&#8217; in-store
        price knowledge. The paper finds variations of in-store price knowledge determinants
        by segment. In particular, the effect of price signs is significant in the
        female sample, while the effect of shopping frequency is significant in the
        male sample. Further research may focus on understanding these differences.
        The paper discusses the study implications for retailers and manufacturers.</description><pubDate>Mon,

        has experienced an accelerating economic growth in recent times and is poised
        to become a middle-income country by 2021. An increasing volume of apparel
        exports and a surging flow of inward remittances are the main drivers of growth.
        A transition to a middle-income country would however require a framework
        of South Asian economic regionalism. The paper argues that Bay of Bengal Industrial
        Growth Belt (BIG-B) is likely an initiative to this end. It will help Bangladesh
        evolve as a &#8220;node &amp; hub&#8221; in the latest phase of globalization

        Effects of Fiscal Policy on the Spanish Economy: Keynesian or Non-Keynesian
        Behavior?</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626788</link><description>Can
        fiscal policy help to the ending of the economic crisis affecting Spain? Given
        this starting point, we study the effects on the Spanish economy of a shock
        to total public receipts or a shock to total public expenditure. With that
        objective in mind, we specify and estimate a vector error correction model
        with exogenous variables, using quarterly monetary and fiscal data for the
        Spanish Economy from 1978 to 2009.The results of our simulations show that
        the effects of shocks to Spanish total government receipts and total government
        expenditure on real variables are permanent, while their effects on nominal
        variables are temporary. The response of the Spanish real GDP to a positive
        shock to total government receipts is positive. In contrast, the response
        of the Spanish real GDP to a positive shock to total government expenditure
        is positive in the short run, but negative in the medium to long run. Consequently,
        these results suggest the existence of non-Keynesian effects related to a
        disturbance on public receipts and the presence of short-run Keynesian effects
        related to a disturbance on public expenditure. Both facts must be taken into
        account when formulating appropriated economic policy measures.</description><pubDate>Mon,

        article is interested in people excluded from traditional markets as employees,
        producers, or consumers. Traditionally they are believed to lack skills required
        by the market. This article describes the processes through which these perceived
        liabilities can be overcome by so called hybrid organizations. Hybrids pursue
        explicit social missions through business-inspired earned-income strategies,
        with the express goal of creating market disequilibria. The paper demonstrates
        the challenges hybrids face and outlines how to overcome them by identifying
        hidden complementarities, by creating new ones, by eliminating the need for
        complementarities, by creating demand for antagonistic assets, or by using

        governance scholarship, so far, has focused on a rather narrow, finance-dominated,
        agency theory perspective. This has been the case even in defining corporate

        justified where it is considered to be financially beneficial to the company.  It
        is on that basis that this article addresses the question of whether such
        a paradigm is justifiable when applied to developing countries such as Kenya.  The
        article is a case study of CSR in Kenya&#8217;s mining industry that is dominated

        entrepreneurial orientation and communication both benefit new product development,
        little attention understands their relationship. According to the resource-based
        view and contingency theory, this study builds a theoretic model in the context
        of the hi-tech sector. In the resource-based view, the present study explores
        the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation, communication strategies,
        and new hi-tech product success. Entrepreneurial orientation implements operations
        communication strategies to reach internal new hi-tech product success. Besides,
        entrepreneurial orientation executes marketing communication strategies to
        arrive at external new hi-tech product success. In contingency theory, technological
        uncertainties positively moderate the relationship between operations communication
        strategies and internal new hi-tech product success. Market uncertainties
        positively moderate the relationship between marketing communication strategies
        and external new hi-tech product success. In conclusion, this study shows
        the roles of communication strategies in the resource-based view and contingency

        into Stroke Unit and Patient Outcomes: A Tale of Four Cities</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625063</link><description>Care
        of stroke patients costs considerably more in specialized stroke units (SU)
        compared to care in general medical wards (GMW) but the technology may be
        cost effective if it leads to significantly improved outcomes.  While randomized
        control trials show better outcomes for stroke patients admitted to SU, observational
        studies report mixed findings. In this paper we use individual level data
        from first-ever stroke patients in four European cities and find evidence
        of selection by the initial severity of stroke into SU in some cities. In
        these cases, the impact of admission to SU on outcomes is overestimated by
        multivariate logit models even after controlling for case-mix. However, when
        the imbalance in patient characteristics and severity of stroke by admission
        to SU and GMW is adjusted using propensity score methods, the differences
        in outcomes are no longer statistically significant in most cases. Our analysis
        explains why earlier studies using observational data have found mixed results
        on the benefits of admission to SU.</description><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jul 2015

        Systems and Reforms on the Competitiveness of West Africa Ports</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625137</link><description>Purpose
        -- The purpose of this paper is to critically discuss the role port labour
        systems can play in the competitiveness of ports in the West African sub region
        and the implications of the choice of system using Ghana as an example.Design/Methodology/Approach
        -- The study basically draws heavily on existing literature to find answers
        to the questions posed. Finding answers to the research questions related
        to identification of available port labour systems, transferability of practices
        from one port to the other and benchmarking on the success of the systems
        lays the foundation for the objectives of the study to be achieved. Based
        on reviewed literature, various concepts and systems employed by ports and
        the resultant strategies adopted by management and the labour force to stand
        for their interest are discussed. Findings -- This study reveals that ports
        undergo lifecycle, which in turn comes along with its orientation either towards
        a social or market system. This depends on several identified factors. Thus,
        in the present assessed situation in the sub region, any West African port
        including Ghana&#8217;s ports and it society at large will be the losers in
        the long run in the face of intensive competition to serve the vast Sahelian
        hinterlands if their reforms are social biased.Practical Implications -- This
        paper is aimed at preparing the ground for future research in this area. The
        issues pointed out have far reaching consequences for the success or failure
        of the reforms that are taking place in various ports in the West Africa sub
        region.Originality/Value -- Effort has been made to point out that seemingly
        peaceful reform could turn disastrous in the long run if the roadmap and conditions
        to achieving the objective of the port reform is not layout and made transparent
        to stakeholders so that labour unions and investors can be proactive in knowing
        their role and adjusting to the future desired status of the port.</description><pubDate>Sun,

        After following the citation network of the seven articles on macroeconomic

        Abstract: The paper presents a newly compiled and improved database of national
        household surveys between 1988 and 2008. In 2008, the global Gini index is
        at 70.5 percent having declined by approximately 2 Gini points over this twenty
        year period. When it is adjusted for the likely under-reporting of higher?
        incomes in surveys by using the gap between national accounts consumption
        and survey means in combination with a Pareto-type imputation of the upper
        tail, the estimate is a much higher global Gini of almost 76 percent. With
        such an adjustment the downward trend in the Gini almost disappears. Tracking
        the evolution of individual country- deciles shows the underlying elements
        that drive the changes in the global distribution: China left the bottom ranks,
        modifying the overall shape of the global income distribution in the process
        and creating an important global &#8220;median&#8221; class that transformed
        a twin-peaked 1988 global distribution into a single-peaked one. The &#8220;winners&#8221;
        were country-deciles which in 1988 stood at the median of the global income
        distribution, 90 percent of which are from Asia in terms of population. The

        Abstract: En este art&#237;culo se propone un modelo te&#243;rico que ayuda
        a entender el funcionamiento de las redes de defensa y corrupci&#243;n del
        narcotr&#225;fico. Con base en las teor&#237;as de juegos y de redes se analizan
        las interacciones estrat&#233;gicas entre los narcotraficantes y sus agentes.
        Se prueba que la densidad de las redes es un determinante fundamental de la
        probabilidad de supervivencia de los narcotraficantes y de los salarios que
        pagan a sus hombres; y que la eficacia de las pol&#237;ticas de represi&#243;n
        de la oferta depende de la densidad de las redes.English Abstract: This paper
        proposes a new theoretical model to unerstand how defence and corruption networks
        associated to drug trafficking operate. Based on game theory and social network
        theory strategic interactions between drug dealers and their agents are analyzed.
        The model shows that network density is a main determinant of the survival
        probability of drug dealers and of wages paid to their security agents; and
        that the efficacy of law enforcement policies depends on network density.</description><pubDate>Sun,

        Abstract: In 2014 Bogota&#8217;s housing prices surpassed the historic average
        and the highest price registered to date. This raises the question of the
        existence of a possible housing bubble. In this article a univariate test
        of explosive growth for nine zones of the city was applied, in order to identify
        if the increasing housing prices are explained by speculation. This study
        found evidence of exuberant growth in most of the zones, although it showed
        differing dynamics within the city. In the most expensive districts part of
        the behaviour of prices is due to speculation. In contrast, in lower value
        zones prices are explained by demand pressures and earning improvements as
        well as government aids reflected on housing interest rate reduction for these
        segments of the population.Spanish Abstract: En 2014 los precios de la vivienda

        by tracing the historical roots of classical liberalism in Mexico, we discuss
        the peaks of liberal thinking and we identify the thinkers behind them. We
        emphasize the influence of Mises and Hayek in the 1940&#8217;s and their effect
        on some Mexican organizations. We show how the liberal tradition in economics
        relates to mainstream neoliberal thinking and Mexican academia. We conclude

        couples have a constitutional right to marriage under the Equal Protection
        Clause, not under Justice Kennedy&#8217;s self-serving and ever-changing definition
        of liberty. The long-term impact of Kennedy&#8217;s decision will be to the
        Court&#8217;s institutional legitimacy. Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that
        the legitimacy of this Court ultimately rests &#8220;upon the respect accorded
        to its judgments,&#8221; which is based on the perception &#8212; and reality
        &#8212; that we exercise humility and restraint in deciding cases according
        to the Constitution and law.&#8221; Justice Kennedy&#8217;s decision eschewed
        these values, giving the Court the power to discover &#8220;new dimensions
        of freedom,&#8221; and to ensure that all citizens, through the Court&#8217;s
        reasoned judgment, are afforded the fullest promise of liberty. Nothing is
        more dangerous to democracy than a court that substitutes reasoned judgment
        for the rule of law, and contemporary attitudes for constitutional imperatives.
        Justice Scalia echoed this sentiment when he wrote separately &#8220;to call

        end, Justice Kennedy decision, like those in Planned Parenthood, Lawrence,

        the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.&#8221;</description><pubDate>Sun,

        Trade &#8211; Virtual Factor Advantages by Technological Differences</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626202</link><description>This
        paper studies a 2x2x2 Ricardo-Heckscher-Ohlin Model (briefly R-H-O model)
        by introducing different technologies into the Heckscher-Ohlin model. The
        key tool of this study is presenting a solution of common commodity prices
        embedded with two sets of local factor prices for each countries, which is
        an endogenous prices fully determined by technological coefficients and by
        factor endowments. A virtual R-H-O system is built by extending Fisher (2010)&#8217;s
        concept of the virtual factor endowments. The virtual R-H-O system is a typical
        H-O model mathematically, so the major H-O theorems can be generalized into
        the virtual R-H-O model directly without much difficulty. The Heckscher-Ohlin
        theorem is generalized as the virtual Heckscher-Ohlin theorem in the R-H-O
        model, which says that a country will export the commodity that uses its virtual
        abundant factor intensively. The virtual factor price equalization theorem
        says that the factor price of a country will be equalized with the virtual
        factor price of its counterpart country. This means that two local (real)
        factor prices are non-equalization. The Rybczynski theorem is generalized
        to a comprehensive trade effects on the changes of local output, commodity
        price, and two local factor prices. One interesting result is that both countries,
        participated trade with different technologies, can even export same (kind
        of) factor content of trade and import the same (kind of) factor content of
        trade. It implies that the capital-labor ratio embodied in consumptions for
        both countries may excesses capital-labor ratio embodied in products, for
        some cases. It is odd to common understanding of factor content of trade by
        Leamer theorem (1980) . This explores a new trade function &#8211;virtual
        factor advantage. Trade compensates the scarce resource worldwide by virtual
        factor endowments. The countries can produce or consume more when they trade
        with virtual factor advantage. The virtual advantage is sourced from technological
        differences and is realized by trade. It proves a new angle to think the &#8220;missing
        trade&#8221; and Leontief&#8217;s paradox, since the factor contents of trade
        are balanced by virtual factor contents, not by real factor content of trade.</description><pubDate>Sun,

        salt reduction programs that operate in the United Kingdom and Australia.
        Drawing on theoretical concepts from the field of regulatory studies, we propose
        a step-wise or &#8220;responsive&#8221; approach that introduces regulatory
        &#8220;scaffolds&#8221; to progressively increase levels of government oversight
        and control in response to industry inaction or under-performance. Our model
        makes full use of the food industry&#8217;s willingness to reduce salt levels
        in products to meet reformulation targets, but recognizes that governments
        remain accountable for addressing major diet-related health risks. Creative
        regulatory strategies can assist governments to fulfil their public health
        obligations, including in circumstances where there are political barriers
        to direct, statutory regulation of the food industry.</description><pubDate>Sun,

        Evidence from the F-Score</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626297</link><description>The
        extant literature shows that institutional investors engage in corporate governance
        to enhance a firm&#8217;s long-term value. Measuring firm performance using
        the F-Score, we examine the persistent monitoring role of institutional investors
        and identify the financial aspects of a firm that institutional monitoring
        improves. We find strong evidence that long-term institutions with large shareholdings
        consistently improve a firm&#8217;s F-Score and that such activity occurs
        primarily through the enhancement of the firm&#8217;s operating efficiency.
        Other institutions reduce a firm&#8217;s F-Score. Moreover, we find evidence
        that, while monitoring institutions improve a firm&#8217;s financial health,
        transient (followed by non-transient) institutions trade on this information.</description><pubDate>Sun,

        the Cyclical Behavior of Loan Spreads</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626394</link><description>This
        paper examines the impact of monetary shocks on the loan spread in a DSGE
        model that combines the cost channel effect of monetary transmission with
        the role of collateral under asymmetric information. Its key feature is the
        endogenous derivation of the default probability that results in a lending
        rate being set as a countercyclical risk premium over the cost of borrowing
        from the central bank. The endogenous probability of default is shown to provide
        an accelerator effect through which monetary shocks can amplify the loan spread.
        The behavior of the spread appears to be consistent with existing empirical
        evidence.</description><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jul 2015 12:53:16 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Financial
        Regulation, Credit and Liquidity Policy and the Business Cycle</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626416</link><description>The
        global financial crisis in 2007 prompted policy makers to introduce a combination
        of bank regulation and macroprudential policies, including non-conventional
        monetary policies, such as interest on reserves and changes in required reserves.
        This paper examines how the combination of such policies can help stabilize
        the effects of real and financial shocks in economies where financial frictions
        are important. Although there is an extensive literature on financial regulation
        and macroprudential policy, and more recently some literature on the effects
        of interest on reserves, these policies are usually examined independently.
        The results point to the importance of coordination between financial regulation
        and monetary policy in minimizing welfare losses following such shocks. Interest
        on reserves is shown to be more effective in reducing welfare losses than
        changes in required reserves and to play a significant role in making stabilization
        policy more effective. The results also suggest an easing of bank capital
        requirements during recessions, when output and loans are falling and the
        risk of default is high.</description><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jul 2015 12:53:16 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Unit
        Total Costs: An Alternative Marginal Cost Proxy for Inflation Dynamics</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626418</link><description>The
        New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC), driven by unit labor costs has been criticized
        for failing to match inflation dynamics and for explaining the duration of
        price contracts. This paper extends recent attempts in the literature to improve
        the fit of the NKPC, by introducing a fuller marginal cost proxy, ''unit total
        costs'', that is derived from both labor and non-labor unit costs; the latter
        includes capital-related costs and production taxes. Borrowing costs are examined
        separately, as in the cost channel literature. Unit total costs are shown
        to improve the fit of the short-run variation in inflation and strengthen
        the empirical support for the role of expectations-based inflation persistence.
        They also imply a duration of fixed nominal contracts that is closer to those
        suggested by firm-level surveys. The cost channel becomes relatively less
        important when unit total costs, rather than unit labor costs, are used as
        a marginal cost proxy.</description><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jul 2015 12:53:16 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>The
        ICSID Under Siege: UNASUR and the Rise of a Hybrid Regime for International
        Investment Arbitration</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626498</link><description>The
        legitimacy and effectiveness of the International Centre for Settlement of
        Investment Disputes (ICSID ) &#8212; a dispute resolution body established
        in 1966 under the auspices of the World Bank &#8212; is a matter of spirited
        debate. It has been argued by some that ICSID&#8217;s ideological and procedural
        bias impedes fairness and by others that its complexity and cost restrict
        access to justice; many contend that the absence of an appeal process has
        exacerbated uncertainty and unpredictability. In 2009, in the wake of rampant
        dissatisfaction and ideological challenge, especially on the part of Latin
        American states, Ecuador proposed the creation of a regional arbitration centre,
        as a new component of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR). This article
        consolidates the myriad of criticisms launched against ICSID and qualitatively
        assesses the relative likelihood and desirability of the UNASUR Arbitration
        Centre as a successful alternative to ICSID and addition to the arbitration
        system. As analyzed in this article, a combination of comprehensive reform
        efforts to ICSID can address a majority of the issues at hand. However, as
        situated in a unique geopolitical context, the UNASUR Arbitration Centre will
        continue to gain momentum, resulting in a hybrid regime for international
        investment law, at least in the short- to medium-term. This hybrid regime
        will be functional, serve an important purpose for Latin American countries,
        and advance the goals of investment liberalization as a valid agenda.</description><pubDate>Sun,

        study the asymptotic properties of the Adaptive LASSO (adaLASSO) in sparse,
        high-dimensional, linear time-series models. We assume that both the number
        of covariates in the model and the number of candidate variables can increase
        with the sample size (polynomially or geometrically). In other words, we let
        the number of candidate variables to be larger than the number of observations.
        We show the adaLASSO consistently chooses the relevant variables as the number
        of observations increases (model selection consistency) and has the oracle
        property, even when the errors are non-Gaussian and conditionally heteroskedastic.
        This allows the adaLASSO to be applied to a myriad of applications in empirical
        finance and macroeconomics. A simulation study shows that the method performs
        well in very general settings with $t$-distributed and heteroskedastic errors
        as well with highly correlated regressors. Finally, we consider an application
        to forecast monthly US inflation with many predictors. The model estimated
        by the adaLASSO delivers superior forecasts than traditional benchmark competitors
        such as autoregressive and factor models.</description><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jul

        deals involve a payment from a branded drug manufacturer to a generic maker
        to delay market entry where, in return for withdrawing the challenge, the
        generic firm receives a payment and/or an authorized licensed entry at a later
        date but before the expiration of the patent itself.  In this paper we focus
        on the incentives involved in reaching such deals and why they are stable.
        We combine the first mover advantage (for the first generic entrant) with
        the ability of the branded manufacturer to launch an authorized generic, and
        describe the conditions under which pay-to-delay deals are an equilibrium
        outcome.  Our model makes explicit the conditions under which authorized generic
        launch by a branded firm is a credible threat to later potential generic challengers
        and works as a device that enables the pay-to-delay deal with the first challenger.</description><pubDate>Sun,

        success of endogenous growth models has led to the wide acceptance that increasing
        returns to scale (IRS) and the positive externalities of knowledge creation
        are inherent features of technology. This acceptance has lent justification
        to stylized models that espouse protectionist trade policies in order to generate
        economic growth. The justification for these policies, however, stems from
        a deeply flawed understanding of what a production function represents and
        the institutional conditions necessary for IRS to be present. Distinguishing
        between physical and institutional technology allows us to conclude that IRS
        are not inherent features of physical production processes, but represent
        the emergent outcome of entrepreneurial choices within certain institutional
        arrangements. We conclude by showing that IRS are not invariant with respect

        that leads to IRS and knowledge creation, and are thus unsuitable growth policies.</description><pubDate>Sun,

        and Practice of Corporate Governance: An Imperative for Nigerian Banks</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2622992</link><description>The
        increasing rate of accounting scandals has steered up discourse on the practice
        of good corporate governance. The banking industry participates in financial
        intermediation by bringing together both the surplus and deficit units of
        the economy thus accentuating the relevance of good corporate governance practice.
        Variables such as the independence, objectivity and integrity of the auditor
        are identified. This paper looks at the practice of good corporate governance
        in the banking industry. A field survey based on stratified sampling technique
        was used in the execution of the study. Four hypotheses were tested using
        the chi square non parametric test on data obtained from the field survey.
        The major findings are that banking institutions design their own codes of
        corporate governance based on the SEC and CBN codes and the independence,
        objectivity and integrity enhances the external auditors&#8217; role in ensuring
        the accountability function of corporate governance in the Nigerian Banking
        industry. The major recommendations are that the banking industry should set
        up a Shareholder&#8217;s Investors&#8217; Grievance Committee and the external
        auditors should also issue a certificate of compliance with corporate governance
        requirements.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:55:46 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Contemporary

        ACT Domestic Violence and Protection Orders Act 2008 has been identified as
        the domestic violence civil legislation in Australia that provides the least
        protection for victims of family violence since it neither mentions specific
        types of domestic violence within its definition nor provides examples. However
        our observation of 18 victims accessing assistance from the Legal Aid ACT
        Domestic Violence and Protection Orders Unit revealed that, despite the shortcomings
        in the definition, it is being widely interpreted by judicial officers at
        this time. Despite asking questions that focus on physical violence, judicial
        officers appear to be interpreting the definition broadly enough to reflect
        the applicants&#8217; experiences. However, given that our findings do not
        include contested final hearings and a belief that indeterminate legislation
        is most vulnerable to practitioners&#8217; values and biases, we recommend
        that the ACT legislation be amended to be more in line with other jurisdictions.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        Evidence from Chinese Cities</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624992</link><description>The
        heterogeneous output effects of inter-city and intra-city transportation infrastructure
        in China are examined using 219 prefecture-level city data from 1999 to 2012.
        Using the panel fully-modified OLS analysis, we find that at the Chinese prefecture-level
        city the estimated contribution rate for highways ranges from 8.3-11.7% compared
        to 4.2-7.7% for railways and 5.8-7.5% for public roads without controlling
        for the effects of fiscal stimulus package in 2009 and 2010. With this package
        in effect, the contribution rate of public road network increases by 2.1%
        and that for highways decreases by 4.6% on average. We also provide empirical
        evidence for the unbalanced transport infrastructure development across regions
        and in three economic zones. It is shown that the eastern region should prioritize
        the intra-city infrastructure investment to alleviate the negative influence
        of within city congestion even though the economic impact of highway investment
        is the largest; while the economic growth of western region of China relies
        heavily on railway development and the middle area depends more on highway

        present a model in which households facing income and housing-price shocks
        use long-term mortgages to purchase houses. Interest rates on mortgages reflect
        the risk of default. The model accounts for observed patterns of housing consumption,
        mortgage borrowing, and defaults. We use the model as a laboratory to evaluate
        default-prevention policies. While recourse mortgages make the penalty for
        default harsher and thus may lower the default rate, they also lower equity
        and increase payments and thus may increase the default rate. Introducing
        loan-to-value (LTV) limits for new mortgages increases equity and thus lowers
        the default rate, with negligible negative effects on housing demand. The
        combination of recourse mortgages and LTV limits reduces the default rate
        while boosting housing demand. Recourse mortgages with LTV limits are also
        necessary to prevent large increases in the mortgage default rate after large
        declines in the aggregate price of housing.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03

        present evidence that event studies can help antitrust agencies forecast impacts
        of mergers on innovation. In large pharmaceutical mergers, cumulative abnormal
        returns on portfolios of rivals predict post-merger changes in the combined

        with lower intensities, which is consistent with softening competition. Matching
        merging firms to similar non-merging firms suggests we can attribute the changes

        &#8220;expenses&#8221; associated with in-process R&amp;D; and provide guidance

        conventional taxi and hotel markets, but there are many others in diverse
        areas such as finance, retail electricity and automobiles.Disruptive innovations
        can deliver important benefits to consumers and can stimulate innovation and
        price competition from established providers. However, they can also give
        rise to legitimate public policy concerns (e.g. safety, privacy) and create
        demands for regulation. Established providers will often lobby for existing
        regulations to be applied to new providers to lessen their competitive advantage,

        Point and Trend Analyses of Annual Expectile Curves of Tropical Storms</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625544</link><description>Motivated
        by the conjectured existence of trends in the intensity of tropical storms,
        this paper proposes new inferential methodology to detect a trend in the annual
        pattern of environmental data. The new methodology can be applied to data
        which can be represented as annual curves which evolve from year to year.
        Other examples include annual temperature or log-precipitation curves at specific
        locations. Within a framework of a functional regression model, we derive
        two tests of significance of the slope function, which can be viewed as the
        slope coefficient in the regression of the annual curves on year. One of the
        tests relies on a Monte Carlo distribution to compute the critical values,
        the other is pivotal with the chi-square limit distribution. Full asymptotic
        justification of both tests is provided. Their finite sample properties are
        investigated by a simulation study. Applied to tropical storm data, these
        tests show that there is a significant trend in the shape of the annual pattern
        of upper wind speed levels of hurricanes.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul

        a paper published in 2008, De Mesnard (http://ssrn.com/abstract=1316002) claimed
        that the old solutions given to these Talmudic problems cannot be completely
        justified using only the Shapley value from the n-person game theory, measuring

        the game assigned to each of these Talmudic problems has a specific characteristic

        leverage is one of the main determinants for defining the optimal capital
        structure of the firm, and has a significant impact on several variables that
        affect the design of the firm''s business strategy. This paper is focussed
        on the potential methodologies exploitable to obtain reliable estimates of
        the firm''s market leverage. This is a relevant issue as many factors make
        obscure the actual dynamics of the firm''s leverage. We estimate the unknown
        parameters that determine the stochastic properties of the unobservable variable,
        by using maximum likelihood estimation and the Kalman filter approach. The
        starting point of our analysis is the seminal Merton model (1974), which describes
        the firm''s asset value dynamics with a pure diffusion process, improved with
        the early default risk as proposed by Duan et al. (2003). We report the simulation
        results for different possible estimation methods, and then perform an empirical

        Risk</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625575</link><description>We
        examine the effect of ex-post information contagion on the ex-ante optimal
        portfolio choices of banks and the welfare losses due to joint default. Because
        of counterparty risk and common exposures, bad news about one bank reveals
        valuable information about another bank, thereby triggering information contagion.
        Systemic risk is defined as the ex-ante probability of joint bank default
        ex post. We find that information contagion increases systemic risk when banks
        are subject to common exposures since portfolio adjustments are small. In
        contrast, when banks are subject to counterparty risk, information contagion
        induces a large shift toward more prudential portfolios and therefore reduces
        systemic risk.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:55:46 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>CCP

        consider pre-funded waterfall resources, recovery tools and assessment powers
        of major European and US central clearing counterparties to assess the possible
        exposure of clearing members. We also investigate loss allocation rules at
        the end of the waterfall and the impact of emerging resolution regimes on
        contingent liquidity. As the resilience of a central clearing counterparty
        depends on the soundness of the member base, we assess the payment capacity
        of a member base under normal and stressed scenarios. We show that under a
        cover 2 stressed scenario, member base quality dramatically erodes, jeopardising
        the ability of clearing members to provide contingent liquidity and to sustain
        the central clearing counterparty''s resilience. We also discuss various conflicts
        of interest that can occur depending on the average quality and heterogeneity
        of member bases.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:55:06 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Environmental
        Privacy</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625583</link><description>Policymakers
        and scholars recognize that individuals comprise an important source of environmental
        harm.  Individuals&#8217; decisions and actions &#8212; running a washing
        machine, driving to work, purchasing a pair of blue jeans &#8212; impose direct
        and indirect impacts on the environment that, while often individually de
        minimis, collectively impose significant harms. Environmental statutes, however,
        rarely target these environmentally significant individual behaviors; regulatory
        attention focuses primarily on industrial sources of environmental harm.  Reorienting
        law and policy to more directly address and limit the harms arising from environmentally
        significant individual behaviors could yield significant benefits.  Doing
        so will, however, require new regulatory approaches and better information
        about environmentally significant behaviors. Before we can deploy norm management
        to encourage voluntary behavior change by educating individuals about the
        environmental harms occasioned by their behavior, we must understand those
        behaviors and their environmental effects, as well as communicate them to
        individuals. Before we can use a market approach to charge individuals for
        consumption of a public environmental good, we must be able to discern and
        track how individuals consume that good.  To effectively impose a mandate
        prohibiting behavior, we must have some means to identify violations and enforce
        the mandate. More generally, better information about environmentally significant
        individual behaviors and their impacts may be crucial for generating the personal
        and political will to support the adoption and implementation of policies
        directed to those behaviors.  And the capacity for developing information
        about environmentally significant individual behaviors and deploying that
        information in support of regulation has grown rapidly with advances in technology.  Remote
        sensing, for example, is being deployed in support of environmental regulation
        in a number of contexts.  Individuals are thus increasingly recognized as
        an important source of environmental harm that warrants greater policy attention;
        designing and implementing effective policies will require information about
        environmentally significant individual behaviors; and technology makes it
        feasible to develop such information.  Developing information about environmentally
        significant individual behaviors can, however, occasion significant concerns
        about privacy.  In light of the growing regulatory and political imperative
        to identify, understand, and address environmentally significant individual
        behaviors and the emerging technical capacity for doing so, it will become
        increasingly necessary for environmental policy to navigate privacy issues.  This
        paper looks to nuisance doctrine, surveillance under environmental statutes
        and Fourth Amendment cases arising in implementation of fish and game laws
        (the hunter enforcement cases) to better understand our experience to date
        balancing the need for environmental information with privacy.  The hunter
        enforcement cases provide a particularly useful analogue for thinking about
        privacy balancing with respect to environmentally significant behaviors.  As
        with other environmentally significant behaviors, the conduct of an individual
        hunter will generally give rise to an environmental harm (for example, impact
        the health of game populations) only when aggregated with the actions of others;
        moreover, the hunter enforcement cases provide a context where regulation
        is being applied primarily to individuals, as opposed to corporate entities.  The
        hunter enforcement cases suggest potentially useful guidance for policymakers
        and courts navigating privacy balancing in the context of environmentally
        significant behaviors.  Notably, although aggregation is required for the
        regulated conduct to give rise to an environmental harm and privacy intrusions
        are incurred by individuals, privacy balancing is nonetheless often struck
        in favor of regulatory enforcement in the hunter enforcement cases.  This,
        in turn, suggests the possibility that privacy balancing might likewise favor
        of regulation with respect to other environmentally significant behaviors,
        provided that the state interest in regulation can be firmly established.</description><pubDate>Sat,

        is well known that quantile regression model minimizes the portfolio extreme

        of the dependent variable, it is possible to optimize different risk and  performance
        indicators. In particular, we introduce a risk-adjusted profitability measure,
        useful in evaluating financial portfolios under a pessimistic perspective,
        since the reward contribution is net of the most favorable outcomes. Moreover,
        as we consider large portfolios, we also cope with the dimensionality issue
        by introducing an l1-norm penalty on the assets weights.</description><pubDate>Sat,

        studies show that future stock returns are predictable.  These findings are
        consistent with either mispricing or risk-based asset pricing models that
        capture the cross section of expected returns.  In this paper, we use a large
        backward-extended insider trading database from 1975 to 2013 to construct
        anomaly-specific measures of mispricing that are designed to be unrelated
        to risk.  We find that the predictive ability of both insider trading and
        anomalies survives when the direction of insider trading agrees with the anomaly
        but the predictive ability of the anomalies completely disappears when insider
        trading disagrees with the anomaly.  In all cases, insider trading continues
        to predict future abnormal returns.  We conclude that mispricing is an important
        component of the predictive ability of all thirteen anomalies we consider.</description><pubDate>Sat,

        activities of third-party debt collectors affect millions of borrowers. However,
        relatively little is known about their impact on consumer credit. To study
        this issue, I investigate whether state debt collection laws affect the ability
        of third-party debt collectors to recover delinquent debts and if this, in
        turn, affects the amount of credit being provided. This paper constructs,
        from state statutes and session laws, a state-level index of debt collection
        restrictions and uses changes in this index over time to estimate the impact
        of debt collection laws on revolving credit. Stricter debt collection regulations
        appear to reduce the number of third-party debt collectors and to lower recovery
        rates on delinquent credit card loans. This, in turn, leads to fewer openings
        of credit cards.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2015 12:53:21 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Why

        Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement for Services?</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625640</link><description>Services
        are regulated for a variety of reasons. Regulation is typically influenced
        by political economy forces and may thus at times reflect protectionist motivations.
        Similar considerations arise for goods, but the potential for protectionist
        capture may be greater in services as many sectors are self-regulated by domestic
        industry. There are specific disciplines on regulation of goods (product standards)
        in the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). This encourages
        the use of international standards and requires that norms restrict trade
        only to the extent necessary to achieve the regulatory objective. WTO disciplines
        on domestic regulation of services are weaker and differ in key respects from
        those for goods. We discuss reasons for this discrepancy and assess whether
        consideration should be given to seeking to adopt the TBT-type disciplines
        that apply to trade in goods.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2015 12:54:32

        present and empirically implement an equilibrium labor market search model
        where risk averse workers facing medical expenditure shocks are matched with
        firms making health insurance coverage decisions. Our model delivers a rich
        set of predictions that can account for a wide variety of phenomenon observed
        in the data including the correlations among firm sizes, wages, health insurance
        offering rates, turnover rates and workers'' health compositions. We estimate
        our model by Generalized Method of Moments using a combination of micro datasets
        including Survey of Income and Program Participation, Medical Expenditure
        Panel Survey and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Employer Health Insurance
        Survey. We use our estimated model to evaluate the equilibrium impact of the

        rate among the workers in our estimation sample from about 22% in the pre-ACA
        benchmark economy to less than 4%. We also find that income-based premium
        subsidies for health insurance purchases from the exchange play an important
        role for the sustainability of the ACA; without the premium subsidies, the
        uninsured rate would be around 18%. In contrast, as long as premium subsidies
        and health insurance exchanges with community ratings stay intact, ACA without
        the individual mandate, or without the employer mandate, or without both mandates,
        could still succeed in reducing the uninsured rates to 7.34%, 4.63% and 9.22%

        paper addresses the process aspect of capability development in connection

        interpretation of different aspects of the self and Granovetter&#8217;s social
        embeddedness framework.  It interprets Sen&#8217;s commitment aspect of the
        self in collective intentionality terms, uses this to explain his view of
        &#8216;identification with&#8217; social groups, and then uses social identity
        theory&#8217;s distinction between relational and categorical social group
        identities to explain a general relationship between individual and collective
        capabilities.  The paper applies this analysis to three broad domains of social
        embeddedness &#8211; market activity, public deliberation, and community participation

        for College: Interim Findings from the Performance-Based Scholarship Demonstration
        in California</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625711</link><description>This
        report presents early findings from a random assignment evaluation of performance-based
        scholarships targeting college-bound high school seniors in California. Performance-based
        scholarships are need-based grants contingent on meeting certain academic
        benchmarks to receive payment &#8212; in this case, a half-time course load
        with a &#8220;C&#8221; or better grade point average (GPA). Unlike merit-based
        scholarships, there are no academic criteria to be eligible for the program
        at the outset. The CFC-PBS scholarship can be taken to any accredited, degree-granting
        college or university in the country. The goal of the CFC-PBS Program is to
        increase the amount of aid available for students while simultaneously providing
        an incentive for academic achievement.  MDRC randomly assigned over 5,000
        students to one of five program groups that were eligible for the incentive
        scholarship, to a group that was eligible for a scholarship without performance
        criteria, or to a control group that received their colleges&#8217; standard
        financial aid packages. This report analyzes three terms of follow-up data
        from the program in California. Overall, the findings in this report show
        the following: &#8226;The CFC-PBS Program was largely implemented as designed.
        &#8226;While few students received the entire amount of the scholarship for
        which they were eligible, most students received some funding. In this way,
        the design of the scholarship enabled more students to receive additional
        financial aid. &#8226;The CFC-PBS Program encouraged more students to matriculate,
        by about 5 percentage points above the control group rate of 84.4 percent.
        This increased matriculation largely occurred at community colleges. However,
        the program had only limited effects on persistence from semester to semester,
        and only for community college students. &#8226;The program had positive impacts
        on academic success. These effects extend to numerous subgroups, such as males,
        females, and students of Latino ethnicity. There is strong evidence that the
        program affected students with lower high school GPAs more than students with
        higher high school GPAs. &#8226;The cost to administer scholarships increased
        as performance requirements were added, but since on the whole, students received
        only a portion of the scholarship amount they were offered, the decrease in
        payments to students more than offset the increased cost of administration.
        All else being equal, scholarships with more performance requirements cost
        less than scholarships with fewer performance requirements.</description><pubDate>Sat,

        Members'' Foreign Source Income</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625732</link><description>Recent
        years have witnessed rising debate, on both sides of the Atlantic, regarding
        how to define the category of individuals whom a given country classifies
        as domestic taxpayers, and who thus may be taxable on their foreign source
        income (FSI) even if they live abroad.  While the United States rules focus
        distinctively on citizenship, the broader issue is better viewed as pertaining
        to the taxation of &#8220;potential community members&#8221; (PCMs) &#8211;
        that is, all those who plausibly might be viewed as members of the home community.This
        paper makes two main points regarding the taxation of PCMs on their FSI.  First,
        the issues turn in large part on drawing a distinction between &#8220;us&#8221;
        and &#8220;them&#8221; &#8211; that is, between people whom we classify as
        members of the home community, and thus whose welfare we care about, and those
        whom we classify as normatively irrelevant (or less relevant) outsiders.  While
        such a distinction is inevitable in a world with separate national governments,
        conventional tax policy and public economics tools shed little direct light
        on how one might operationalize it.Second, for PCMs whom a given country classifies
        as domestic taxpayers, past debate has over-focused on issues of mitigating
        &#8220;double taxation&#8221; through exemption or foreign tax credits.  It
        should instead focus distinctly on the questions of (a) how heavily or lightly
        one should tax domestic taxpayers&#8217; FSI in particular cases, and (b)
        how foreign taxes paid should affect domestic liability.  Refocusing the analysis
        not only helps to inform one&#8217;s understanding of the choice between the
        two standard tools, but also may suggest considering blended approaches that
        might avoid the worst features of each.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul

        with decreasing absolute risk aversion, then a search for alpha will in theory
        create undesirable (negative) residual coskewness.  Empirically, alpha and
        residual coskewness relative to the market are indeed negatively correlated
        in the cross-section of mutual funds.  Most hedge fund strategies also have
        negative residual coskewness.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:55:46

        and the Director Labor Market</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625798</link><description>This
        paper examines the stability and composition of acquirer boards around mergers.  Contrary
        to perceived wisdom, composition of the post-merger board changes substantially
        and these variations are significantly different from both non-merger years
        and non-merging firms.  These adjustments reflect firms upgrading skills associated
        with executive and deal experience.  Board changes also reflect bargaining
        between targets and acquirers rather than CEOs seeking a more friendly board.  Conversely,
        director selection in non-merger years is driven by general skills and diversity.  Overall,
        our analyses provide insight into the dynamic nature of board structure around
        mergers and characteristics valued in the director labor market.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        Compensation Convexity and Firm Crash Risk</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625852</link><description>This
        paper demonstrates that executive compensation convexity, measured as the
        sensitivity of managerial equity compensation portfolios to stock volatility,
        predicts firm-specific crashes.  A bottom-to-top decile change in compensation
        convexity results in a 21% increase in a firm''s crash risk after controlling
        for managerial price-increasing incentives.  In contrast, there is no robust
        evidence of a symmetric relation between compensation convexity and a firm''s
        idiosyncratic positive jump risk.  We exploit an exogenous shock to compensation
        convexity, arising from a change in the expensing treatment of executive stock
        options, in further supporting our interpretations within a natural experiment
        setting.  Our results suggest that managerial equity compensation portfolios
        do not augment a firm''s future idiosyncratic crash risk because they link
        managerial wealth to equity prices, but rather because they tie managerial
        wealth to the volatility of a firm''s equity.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04

        Listed Chinese SOEs?</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625873</link><description>We
        examine whether the corporate control market is an important governance mechanism
        that the controlling shareholders of publicly listed Chinese SOEs employ to
        improve the performance of less efficiently run Chinese SOEs. Using an econometric
        methodology advocated by Maddala (1983), we show that expected future performance
        improvement is an important consideration in publicly listed Chinese SOEs&#8217;
        control transfer decisions. This result holds for both state-to-private and
        state-to-state control transfers and the effect is stronger for publicly listed
        Chinese SOEs domiciled in provinces with stronger institutional environments.
        There is also preliminary evidence that the firms other than the control transfer
        target controlled by the acquiring ultimate owners are more efficiently run
        than the firms controlled by the selling ultimate owners. Overall, our results
        suggest that the Chinese Government actively uses the corporate control market
        to help improve the performance of publicly listed Chinese SOEs.</description><pubDate>Sat,

        Demand, Supply, and Heterogeneity in the Trade Elasticity.</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625937</link><description>Models
        of heterogeneous firms with selection into export market participation generically
        exhibit aggregate trade elasticities that vary across country-pairs. Only
        when heterogeneity is assumed Pareto-distributed do all elasticities collapse
        into a unique elasticity, estimable with a gravity equation. This paper provides
        a theory-based method for quantifying country-pair specific elasticities when
        moving away from Pareto, i.e. when gravity does not hold. Combining two firm-level
        customs datasets for which we observe French and Chinese individual sales
        on the same destination market over the 2000-2006 period, we are able to estimate
        all the components of the dyadic elasticity: i) the demand-side parameter
        that governs the intensive margin and ii) the supply side parameters that
        drive the extensive margin. These components are then assembled under theoretical
        guidance to calculate bilateral aggregate elasticities over the whole set
        of destinations, and their decomposition into different margins. Our predictions
        fit well with econometric estimates, supporting our view that micro-data is
        a key element in the quantification of non-constant macro trade elasticities.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        in countries with powerful labor unions and high coverage of bargaining coordination.
        The positive effect of collective bargaining on firms&#8217; attractiveness
        remains after we saturate specifications with comprehensive sets of fixed
        effects and industry-country characteristics. Furthermore, we find that target

        returns. We also find that this positive relationship is stronger in labor-intensive
        industries, supporting a possible source of takeover gains as unlocking operational
        efficiency through weakening wage and employment conditions.</description><pubDate>Sat,

        and Growth Correlation in Sub-Saharan Africa</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625956</link><description>This
        paper studies the relationship between financial integration and the correlation
        of GDP growth in sub-Saharan African countries. The dynamic nature of financial
        integration is first emphasized in order to account for both effects of risk
        sharing on the one hand and intermediation margins and bank rates of return
        on the other hand. In addition to considering simple variables of growth correlation,
        we exploit the multiple dimensions of business cycle synchronization first
        by allowing for asymmetric dynamics during expansion and recession, and by
        further acknowledging the importance of de-synchronized fluctuations to allow
        for the costs and benefits of financial integration for an individual country.
        Our main results are threefold. First, it seems that the financial integration
        variables are not informative about the likelihood of observing co-movements
        between the recession phases (after controlling for different variables influencing
        the business cycle). Secondly, our estimates portray a situation in which
        both risk-sharing and the convergence of price-based indicators lead to economic
        specialization rather than to a convergence of the expansion phases. Thirdly,
        the price-based indicators provide better information than risk-sharing variables
        to account for business cycle synchronization.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        Assessing the Global Impact of a Chinese Hard Landing Through Trade and Commodity
        Price Channels.</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625958</link><description>China''s
        rapid growth over the past decade has been one of the main drivers of the
        rise in mineral commodity demand and prices. At a time when concerns about
        the sustainability of China''s growth model are rising, this paper assesses
        to what extent a hard landing in China would impact other countries, with
        a focus on trade and commodity price channels. After reviewing the main arguments
        pointing to a hard landing scenario &#8211; historical rebalancing precedents,
        over-investment, unsustainable debt trends, and a growing real estate bubble
        &#8211; we focus on a sample of thirty-six countries, and use a global VAR
        methodology adapted to conditional forecasting to simulate the impact of a
        Chinese hard landing. We model metal and oil markets separately to account
        for their different end-use patterns and consumption intensity in China, and
        we identify three specific transmission channels to net commodity exporters:
        through real exports, through income effects (related to commodity prices),
        and through investment (a fall in commodity prices reducing incentives to
        invest in the mining and energy sectors); we also look at the role played
        by the exchange rate as a shock absorber. According to our estimates, emerging
        economies (ex. China) would be hardest hit &#8211; with a 7.5 percent cumulated
        growth loss after five years &#8211;, in particular in South-East Asia but
        also in commodity-exporting regions such as Latin America; advanced economies
        would be less affected. The "growth gap" between emerging and advanced economies
        would be considerably reduced, leading to partial recoupling.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        and Wealth Redistribution Between the Members and Sponsor: The USS Rule Change
        in October 2011</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625963</link><description>The
        redesign of defined benefit pension schemes usually results in a substantial
        redistribution of wealth between age cohorts of members, pensioners, and the
        sponsor. This is the first study to quantify the redistributive effects of
        a rule change by a real world scheme (the Universities Superannuation Scheme,
        USS) where the sponsor underwrites the pension promise. In October 2011 USS
        closed its final salary scheme to new members, opened a career average revalued
        earnings (CARE) section, and moved to &#8216;cap and share&#8217; contribution
        rates. We find that the pre-October 2011 scheme was not viable in the long
        run, while the post-October 2011 scheme is probably viable in the long run,
        but faces medium term problems. In October 2011 future members of USS lost
        65% of their pension wealth (or roughly &#163;100,000 per head), equivalent
        to a reduction of roughly 11% in their total compensation, while those aged
        over 57 years lost almost nothing. The riskiness of the pension wealth of
        future members increased by a third, while the riskiness of the present value
        of the sponsor&#8217;s future contributions reduced by 10%. Finally, the sponsor&#8217;s
        wealth increased by about &#163;32.5 billion, equivalent to a reduction of
        26% in their  pension costs.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2015 12:53:52

        a noisy rational expectations framework with costly information, some agents
        expend resources to become informed, and earn a return for their efforts by
        trading with the uninformed. Applying this insight, we examine the proposition
        that an increase in ETF ownership is accompanied by a decline in pricing efficiency
        for the underlying component securities.  Our tests show an increase in ETF
        ownership is associated with: (1) higher trading costs (measured as bid-ask
        spreads and price impact of trades); (2) an increase in &#8220;stock return
        synchronicity&#8221; (measured as the co-movement of firm-level stock returns
        with general market and related-industry stock returns); (3) a decline in
        &#8220;future earnings response coefficients&#8221; (measured as the predictive
        power of current returns for future earnings), and (4) a decline in the number
        of analysts covering the firm.  Collectively, our findings support the view
        that increased ETF ownership can lead to higher trading costs and lower benefits
        from information acquisition, a combination which results in less informative
        security prices for the component firms.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul

        Devaluation Fail to Kick-Start an Export Led Growth in Greece?</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626001</link><description>Much
        has been said about the results of the austerity program dictated in Greece
        by the &#8216;Troika&#8217;. The official creditors initially sanctioned an
        implementation of the agreed conditionality program (included in the Memorandum
        of Understanding that also provisioned the official loans to the Greek government)
        that principally focused on increasing taxes and labor market reforms that
        facilitated the sharp fall of private sector wages. During the third year
        of the implementation of the program they did  complement this tax spree with
        horizontal cuts in pensions, medical benefits and public sector wages, failing
        to touch the key distortions of both the pension system and the public sector
        wage structure. Growth enhancing progressive structural reforms, were not
        deemed a priority and basically were off the agenda with the exception of
        a few half-hearted and therefore incomplete attempts. To make matters worse,
        a number of ill advised policies and strategic political decision directly
        undermined the ability of the productive part of the economy to contribute
        towards the stated goal of an export-led recovery of the Greek economy. In
        this paper we present facts that document the impact of the adopted strategy
        on employment and wages, updating our related previous analysis, and extent
        the arguments to further elaborate on the impact of the adopted policies on
        the export performance of the Greek economy.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04

        Market Performance: Facts and Myths that Can Help Devise a Useful Growth Strategy.</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626009</link><description>The
        Greek paradox of falling wages that do not lead to increased exports can be
        reconciled with standard economic theory, once a number of facts are taken
        into account. Actually, exports of goods that have not been facing the additional
        adverse effect of highly increased after tax energy prices for industrial
        users have been increasing steadily during the crisis. In addition, once the
        collapse of the economy was well under way, labour market reforms in Greece
        introduced flexibility that stabilized employment, especially among SME&#8217;s.
        At the same time relatively modest product market reforms and the distortions
        of a tax system that overtaxes honest productive individuals and businesses,
        which are by definition more likely to be engaged in businesses that offer
        higher value tradable goods, further undermined growth and export prospects.
        Finally, real interest rates on corporate loans, wages and the efficiency
        of product markets are found to have an important impact on manufacturing
        employment. Product market reforms and reducing uncertainty thus emerge as
        key policy priorities if the increase in employment, export performance and
        wages are a desired policy priority.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2015

        study estimates a reduced-form regression model for mortality rates due to
        alcoholic liver diseases, with alcohol prices and income as explanatory variables.
        Panel data cover the years 2000-2010 for 21 member countries of the European
        Union. In the reduced-form, prices affect mortality rates indirectly through
        the demand for alcohol, while income has potential direct and indirect effects.
        Country and time fixed-effects are used to control for other factors that
        influence alcohol consumption and mortality. Special attention is paid to
        outliers in the data and final results are based on the MS-estimator for robust
        regressions. Regression results for alcohol prices and income are sensitive
        to adjustments for stationary data and down-weighting of outliers and other
        influential data points. Final results indicate that alcohol prices do not
        affect mortality rates due to chronic liver diseases. Empirical results in

        paper systematically explores liquidity and volatility forecasting for Aluminum,
        Copper, Fuel Oil, and Sugar futures contracts in China using intraday and
        daily data. Adopting three popular liquidity estimators, we first show that
        contracts with three months to delivery enjoy the best liquidity for all commodities
        under scrutiny. The finding that nearby contracts are less liquid than the
        more distant contracts is novel and contrary to the pattern in other major
        futures markets, and it results from unique institutional regulation in the
        Chinese futures markets. Utilizing more distant contracts and implementing
        four widely adopted volatility models for forecasting against alternative
        true volatility proxies, we provide strong evidence that the ARFIMA model
        consistently produces the best forecasts or forecasts not inferior to the
        best. This is robust for contracts with different liquidity levels.</description><pubDate>Sat,

        Affect Fertility: Evidence from Nigeria</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626045</link><description>Using
        data from the  Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), this paper estimates
        the effect on fertility of a legal reform in Nigeria in 1999 that lowered
        the value of women''s testimony in court.  I find that the yearly probability
        of giving birth of women exposed to the reform did not change in general.
        For women exposed to the enforced reform, this probability increased by at
        least 0.04.  Using stated preferences on fertility, I find that fertility
        increased among women who want fewer children than their husband does, but
        decreased among women who want more children than their husband does.  I examine
        the hypothesis that the reform increased for women the value of being married,
        and hence decreased their intra-household bargaining power,  consequently
        shifting fertility decisions in the direction of husbands'' preferences.</description><pubDate>Sat,

        economic entity doctrine allows the Commission to fine a parent company if
        its subsidiary has infringed the competition rules. In such cases, the Commission
        holds the subsidiary and the parent jointly and severally liable. The EU Courts
        have acknowledged this sanctioning concept as based on an interpretation of
        the notion of &#8220;undertaking&#8221;. Yet the economic entity doctrine
        still faces criticism. It is argued that being a parent can hardly suffice
        to establish liability for the infringement of the subsidiary. Also, the rule
        stating that a 100% shareholder is presumed to form an economic entity with
        its subsidiary is seen to conflict with the in dubio pro reo principle. As
        far as joint and several liability is concerned, practical problems arise
        with respect to recourse litigation between the corporate entities. It is
        argued in this article that irrespective of the interpretation of the notion
        of undertaking in terms of the competition rules, it is necessary to respect
        the legal personality of group companies and essential legal principles of
        sanctioning: namely the principle of personal responsibility.</description><pubDate>Sat,

        Theory Perspective on Retirement Savings</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626069</link><description>The
        primary motivation for retirement savings policy is the view that many of
        us, if left to our own devices, will not save enough for retirement. Special
        tax subsidies for employer-sponsored retirement plans &#8212; a principal
        component of the federal policy scheme &#8212; have made such plans the predominant
        vehicle for private savings for retirement. A growing body of evidence shows
        that the details of plan design can have large effects on savings outcomes.
        The design of the &#8220;choice architecture&#8221; of these plans, however,
        is delegated to employers. We analyze the incentives for employer plan design
        produced by the labor market. Employers offer retirement plans to attract
        workers. If those workers make systematic mistakes in their retirement savings
        decisions, then the labor market will produce incentives for plan designs
        that generally fail to effectively address the problems. Indeed, the presence
        of workers who undersave due to myopia results in equilibrium employer plan
        designs that exploit the myopic by lowering their total compensation. Our
        analytic framework provides novel explanations for a range of features of
        plan design, including the high prevalence of matching contributions, the
        use of low default contribution rates in automatic enrollment plans, the shift
        away from annuities toward lump sum distributions, and the offering of investment
        options with excessive fees. The regulation of these plans should be reformed
        to address the problems with employer incentives that we identify. More fundamentally,

        Investor in the Stock of Market of Nepal</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626072</link><description>An
        investor may have specific investment objective for his/her investment. Investment
        objective is the motive for which investment is made. Some investors may invest
        fund for regular income while others may prefer capital gain. In general,
        investment is concerned with risk taking activity for future returns over
        a long period which is not necessary to be marketable in short run. The primary
        source of return is earnings of the firm and investment is based on sufficient
        information and analysis. On the other hand, speculation is short-term phenomenon
        that involves purchasing marketable securities with the expectation of getting
        high return in short period. The primary source of return is changes in the
        market price of an asset and speculation is made with limited information
        and analysis. Similarly, gambling is an act of risk taking activity without
        having proper knowledge of associated risk. It is an unplanned and non-scientific
        act based on tips, rumors, hunches, etc.The general objective of this study
        was to identify the current state of investment motive of individual investors
        in the stock market of Nepal. It further intended to identify the association
        between information and analysis, investment horizon, age level, academic
        qualification and experience in stock market with investment motive of the
        individual investor.The study was quantitative in nature. The study adopted
        exploratory survey research design and correlation research design. This study
        took the sample of 111 people who have invested their money into the stock
        of corporations, using purposive convenience sampling method.This study finds
        that the most of the investors had the investment motive of speculation and
        least of the investors had the investment motive of gambling. There was a
        positive relationship between information and analysis, investment horizon,
        age level, and experience in stock market with investment motive. Further
        this study also revealed a moderate association between academic qualification
        and investment motive.The results reported in this study hold several important
        practical implications. Whether the investment motive is investment or speculation,
        investors must search adequate information and analysis before investing into
        the stocks of company. The results found that rumors and tips are playing
        vital role in Nepalese stock markets. Investors are recommended to leave such
        practices. They must make their investment decisions based on adequate information
        and analysis, since it is always difficult to lose hard earned money. Similarly,
        investors can have knowledge of basic accounting and finance, so that they
        can analyze financial statements and make wise investment decision based on
        the firms&#8217; financial statements. Therefore, investors should know about
        the company they are investing, despite of investment motive as speculation
        or investment. It is recommended to the investors to leave the investment
        motive of gambling and invest in the firm with proper and adequate information
        and analysis.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2015 12:53:52 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Analyst
        Reputation, Communication, and Information Acquisition</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626076</link><description>Earlier
        studies have shown that reputational concerns tend to reduce agents'' opportunistic
        behavior. However, a recent study by Morris argued that analysts'' (experts'')
        reputational concerns may discourage truthful communication when they try
        to avoid being perceived as being misaligned with investors. In this paper,
        I examine the effect of reputational concerns on communication in a setting
        where analysts can choose their precision endogenously. Because both misaligned
        and aligned analysts want investors to trust their reports in the future,
        both will aim to build a reputation for being aligned. In equilibrium, aligned
        analysts will acquire more information than misaligned analysts. As a result,
        investors may favorably update their beliefs about the analysts'' type when
        the report is proven to be accurate. Therefore, both types of analysts will
        have reputational incentives to communicate truthfully. The paper also derives
        conditions under which the analysts'' reputational concerns have a nonmonotonic
        impact on aligned analysts'' equilibrium precision choices and investors''
        welfare.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2015 12:54:43 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Does

        equity is subject to public debate regarding its impact on economies.  While
        several papers have documented the effects of private equity on a firm level,
        the effects of private equity on an industry level is hardly addressed. This
        paper analyzes the influence of private equity on industry performance across
        twelve European countries. We find that the relative investment level of private
        equity positively influences the industries&#8217; productivity, operating
        income, number of employees and average wage level. Causality tests show that
        the relative level of private equity investments causes the changes in the
        industries and not vice-versa.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2015 12:54:37

        and Price Efficiency in Laboratory Markets</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626079</link><description>An
        enduring issue in financial reporting is whether and how salient summary measures
        of firm performance (&#8220;earnings metrics&#8221;) affect market price efficiency.
        In laboratory markets, we test the effects of salient earnings metrics, which
        vary in how they combine persistent and transitory elements, on investor information
        search, beliefs about value, offers to trade, and market price efficiency.
        We find that including transitory elements in salient earnings metrics causes
        traders to search unnecessarily for further information about these elements
        and to overestimate their effect on fundamental value relative to a rational
        benchmark. In contrast, separately displaying persistent elements in earnings
        increases the accuracy of traders&#8217; value estimates. Prices generally
        reflect traders&#8217; beliefs about value, and prices are most efficient
        when transitory elements are excluded from earnings metrics entirely. Our
        study contributes to research on salience effects in financial reporting by
        showing that including transitory elements in salient earnings metrics causes
        inefficient information search and biased beliefs about value that can aggregate
        to affect market prices. We also contribute to research in experimental markets
        by showing that redundant disclosure is not always beneficial; redundant disclosure
        of transitory earnings elements, in particular, appears to have negative consequences
        for investor behavior and market efficiency.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04

        Federal Reserve System failed to prevent the collapse of intermediation during
        the Great Depression (1929-1933) and took action as if it was unaware of policies
        that should have been taken in the event of widespread bank runs. The National
        Banking Era panics and techniques to alleviate them should have been useful
        references for how to alleviate a financial crisis. We suggest that the overwhelming
        effort to finance World War I combined with a perspective held by contemporary
        Federal Reserve officials that the central bank legislation was sufficient
        to overcome financial crises are key reasons why the historical experiences
        were overlooked.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2015 12:54:44 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Population

        countries are at different stages of demographic transition. While Central
        and South Asian countries are relatively young and will remain so for some
        time, East and Southeast Asia are expected to age at an unprecedented rate
        in the next few decades. Japan has reached the future first. Other nations,
        such as China, are still young but ageing faster than many advanced economies,
        including Australia and the USA. This demographic shift has considerable implications
        for the development of social policy. Here too, countries differ widely. This
        paper sets the context for the rest of the volume. The focus is mostly on
        countries in East and Southeast Asia, but it includes contrasting comparisons
        to key regional countries such as India and Australia. First, the paper presents
        the context: the demographic, urbanization, and social trends facing Asia.
        Second, it tackles the allocation of resources for the elderly, in particular,
        by summarizing approaches to two areas of social policy most pertinent to
        population ageing: retirement income and health care.</description><pubDate>Sat,

        in Southeast Asia: An Assessment</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626187</link><description>This
        paper assesses public pension programs in select Southeast Asian economies
        (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam &#8211;
        henceforth referred to as the SEA6) and the key issues facing them. The criteria
        used in assessing pension systems are the philosophy of pension design, the
        extent of coverage, investment policies and performance, and administrative
        and compliance costs. The paper argues that three broad reform directions
        to strengthen public pensions merit consideration. The first direction is
        to enhance the professionalism of the existing provident and pension fund
        organizations, including their governance practices. The second direction
        is to strengthen the role of noncontributory budget&#8208;financed pensions
        (e.g. social pensions). The third is to adopt a systemic perspective to pension
        reform that includes reforms in complementary areas (labor markets, public
        financial management practices, and the civil service); developing a financing&#8208;mix
        of pensions; and lastly, improving effective coverage by exploring complementarities
        between health care and pension programs.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul

        the policy objectives of reducing patient&#8211;nurse ratios and the length
        of hospital stays. As a result, hospitals have responded by greatly increasing
        the number of expensive beds for acute care. However, this was not exactly

        problem of systemic political corruption is so well-known that the vast majority
        of Americans hold Congress in contempt. Scholars and reformers have focused
        on remedies such as campaign finance and lobbying regulation, but these remedies
        typically sacrifice First Amendment freedoms, or require unrealistic changes
        in voter behavior. Public choice scholars tend to condemn the system without
        offering remedies beyond scaling back the scope of government. James Madison
        and the other Framers of the Constitution are famous for designing a federal
        structure that, unlike the regime of George III, was to protect the People
        from tyranny and corruption. The Framers relied chiefly on two organizational
        mechanisms. The principal safeguard against tyranny is intramural rivalry
        among the branches of government, relying on the separation of powers and
        &#8220;checks and balances&#8221; such as the presidential veto power and
        congressional control of spending. Elections serve as the chief safeguard
        against corruption, which is best thought of as a failure of agents (political
        representatives) to promote the welfare of their principals, the People. Several
        First Amendment freedoms reinforce each of these mechanisms.The politics of
        ratification and fear of tyranny also led the Framers to design a limited
        federal government. Nearly two and one-half centuries later, the limits have
        disappeared. The federal government now exercises vast power and touches nearly
        every aspect of our lives. This essay explores potential Madisonian remedies
        for the surge of lawful corruption that has accompanied this expansion. The
        People would be incapable of monitoring or disciplining systemic corruption
        even if elections were not themselves corrupted. The solution is to shift
        the focus of reform away from tinkering with elections and First Amendment
        freedoms, and to turn instead to interdiction of legislative outcomes that
        reduce aggregate well-being or the welfare of the poorest. This requires an
        extension of Madisonian intramural rivalry to include a branch concerned primarily
        with the consequences rather than the causes of corruption.</description><pubDate>Sat,

        the correlations of VAR forecast errors at different horizons, this paper
        analyses the dynamics of co-movements between crude oil and food prices. For
        each food price considered, the VAR model is estimated on two subsample periods:
        a pre-commodity boom (1990M1-2006M12) and a post-boom period (2007M1-2015M12).  Results
        show strong positive co-movements between the crude oil and food prices in
        the aftermath of the commodity boom, while no statistically significant co-movements
        are observed over the pre-boom period. Our findings then provide an additional
        empirical evidence on the actual linkages between the crude oil and agricultural

        different types of pledges, namely private, public and irrevocable ones, which
        differ in individual cost of not keeping a promise. Public pledges appear
        to be associated to lower donation levels. Irrevocable pledges ensure an amount
        of donations equal to donations in absence of pledges. Moreover, a significant
        number of individuals keep their promises, in presence of either private or

        paper reports results from a real-effort experiment in which men and women
        are paired to form a two-member team and asked to execute a real-effort task.
        Each participant receives an equal share of the team''s output. Workers who
        perform better than their partner can punish him/her by imposing a fine. We
        manipulate the teams'' gender composition (man-man, man-woman, and woman-woman)
        to analyze whether an individual''s performance and sanctioning behavior depends
        on his/her gender and the gender interaction within the team. The data show
        that, on average, men perform slightly better than women. A man''s performance
        will deteriorate when paired with a woman, while a woman''s performance will
        improve when paired with a woman. When underperforming, women are sanctioned
        more often and more heavily than men; if sanctioned, men tend to improve their
        performance, while women''s performance does not change.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        paper studies the trade-off between the benefits (e.g., experience, learning)
        and costs (e.g., CEO-firm mismatch, entrenchment) that arise over a CEO&#8217;s
        time in office. We find that CEO tenure exhibits an inverted U-shaped relation
        with firm value, profitability, and M&amp;A; announcement returns. Results
        stand various robustness tests including alternative explanations and CEO-firm
        fixed effects. For the average S&amp;P; 1500 firm the costs of tenure start
        to outweigh the benefits after about 12 years. Optimal CEO tenure, however,
        varies significantly depending on a firm&#8217;s economic environment that
        determines the cost-benefit relation of tenure. Results from sudden deaths,
        used to address endogeneity, confirm that high-tenure CEOs reduce shareholder
        value. While this study suggests that frequent CEO turnover can be valuable,
        it does not support a one-size-fits-all policy of CEO term limits.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        has documented how social connections help reduce borrowing cost. However,
        a related question which would be raised first is, do connections formed through
        personal ties between firms and banks facilitate the establishment of firm-bank
        relationships? To answer this question, I focus on professional connections
        and construct two types of connection measures with a sample of listed firms
        in Germany from 2004 to 2012. Addressing reverse causality concerns and controlling
        for a set of firm and bank characteristics, I find that more past connections
        between firms and banks lead to a higher probability of relationship banking.
        Connections also foster the transmission of soft information, and the effect
        of connection is larger when firm is distant, while it gets weaker given the
        firm is riskier and with information asymmetry. Decomposing connections according
        to the types of board positions, connected individuals holding supervisory
        board positions contribute the most to relationship banking.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        aim of this research is to analyze and find out the major issue of tax treaties
        law in Kosovo. In this analysis we have used the research method of case study.
        The results of research show that the legal framework for the elimination
        of double taxation, after 1999, initially started its establishment journey
        from the United Nations Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Taking into
        consideration the specifications of the political status, the process for
        the establishment of the unilateral and bilateral legal framework has been
        made with mistakes, slow and with delays. Following its declaration of independence,
        Kosovo has paid greater attention to tax treaties. Although double taxation
        relief in Kosovo may be obtained either unilaterally or under a tax treaty,
        there remains a lot of work to be done for the completion of the necessary
        framework for elimination of double taxation. The double taxation relief provided
        by a tax treaty prevails over the domestic relief. The study is of particular

        Wage on the Gender Pay Gap &#8211; A Simulation-Based Study for Germany</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2626402</link><description>In
        a simulation-based study with data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study
        (SOEP), we analyze the effects of the newly introduced statutory minimum wage
        of 8.50 Euro per working hour in Germany on the gender wage gap. In our first
        scenario where we abstain from employment effects, the pay differential is
        reduced by 2.5 percentage points from 19.6% to 17.1%, due to a reduction of
        the sticky-floor effect at the bottom of the wage distribution. In more realistic
        scenarios where we incorporate minimum wage effects on labor demand, a further
        reduction of the pay gap by 0.2 pp (1.2 pp) in case of a monopsonistic (neoclassical)
        labor market is achieved. However, this comes at the cost of job losses by
        which women are more strongly affected than men. The magnitude of job losses
        ranges between 0.2% and 3.0% of all employees. It is higher in a neoclassical
        market setting and positively related to the assumed wage elasticity.</description><pubDate>Sat,

        to Financial Risk Management Strategies</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2591620</link><description>The
        Basel III Accord requires that banks and other Authorized Deposit-taking Institutions
        (ADIs) communicate their daily risk forecasts to the appropriate monetary
        authorities at the beginning of each trading day, using one of a range of
        alternative risk models to forecast Value-at-Risk (VaR). The risk estimates
        from these models are used to determine the daily capital charges (DCC) and
        associated capital costs of ADIs, depending in part on the number of previous
        violations, whereby realized losses exceed the estimated VaR. In this paper
        we define risk management in terms of choosing sensibly from a variety of
        risk models and discuss the optimal selection of the risk models. Previous
        approaches to model selection for predicting VaR proposed combining alternative
        risk models and ranking such models on the basis of average DCC, or other
        quantiles of its distribution. These methods are based on the first moment,
        or specific quantiles of the DCC distribution, and supported by restrictive
        evaluation functions. In this paper, we consider robust uniform rankings of
        models over large classes of loss functions that may reflect different weights
        and concerns over different intervals of the distribution of losses and DCC.
        The uniform rankings are based on recently developed statistical tests of
        stochastic dominance (SD). The SD tests are illustrated using the prices and
        returns of VIX futures. The empirical findings show that the tests of SD can
        rank different pairs of models to a statistical degree of confidence, and
        that the alternative(recentered) SD tests are in general agreement.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        Auditing, assumed to be a function subservient to the statutory financial

        sub-function under &#8216;management accounting&#8217;, readily being practiced
        by organizations these days. The reason for the same may be attributable to
        the growing size, complexities and span of the organizations.The laws and
        regulations in India also have time and again acknowledged the growing importance
        of internal auditing in organizations. The practice of &#8216;internal auditing&#8217;
        in India, although is not comparable with the practice in US and other developed
        economies across the globe, but has considerably evolved and continuously
        evolving from its traditional perspective.This article encapsulates the major
        features and perspectives of the internal auditing practices in India, as
        studied during a dedicated detailed survey of lead companies in India. The

        An Inquiry into the Governing Legal Regime</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624596</link><description>Common
        Article 3 encourages the parties to a non-international armed conflict to
        bring into force international humanitarian law provisions through the conclusion
        of special agreements. Since armed opposition groups have become one of the
        main actors in the armed conflicts of the last few decades, the relevance
        of those agreements as means to enhance compliance with IHL has grown as well.
        In a way that is consistent with the principle of equality of belligerents,
        the decision-making process of special agreements recognizes that all the
        parties to the conflict participate in the clarification and expansion of
        the applicable rights and obligations. This provides incentives for armed
        opposition groups to respect the IHL rules they have actually contributed
        to create. However, upon the conclusion of such agreements it remains unclear
        what the legal regime is that governs them. This paper will argue that they
        should be governed by international instead of domestic law, or something
        in between.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:56:54 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Does

        transition is a process of change from a centrally planned economic system
        to a market-based economy. The process started with the fall of the Berlin
        Wall in 1989. There were no theoretical foundations and experiences for the
        process of economic transition. The neoliberal Washington Consensus suggestions
        of fast liberalisation and privatisation were often employed in the transition
        region, but failed to bring the expected fruits. Countries became rather leery
        about further reforms since 2005. The membership of the European Union brought
        certain positive changes and improvements in the economies of countries in
        Central and Eastern Europe. This has, however, happened at the cost: foreign
        debt went through the roof. The danger is that foreign debt may choke growth
        in the future, especially when rates of interest increase. The end of economic
        transition is not yet in sight.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:55:06

        Antitrust: Why Losses Should Count More than Gains &#8212; An Implication
        of Behavioral Economics for Antitrust Losses</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624821</link><description>In
        mainstream antitrust law the nature of economic efficiency has not been investigated
        in great depth. Such an investigation has important implications for antitrust
        law and economics. Among these are the following: (1) Behavioral economics
        shows that consumer surplus measures of losses underestimate consumer damages,
        often considerably, while producer surplus measures generally do not. (2)
        Thus an efficiency-based approach to antitrust should weigh consumer losses
        much more heavily than producer gains. (3) This conclusion has profound effects
        on many areas of antitrust, including every area that involves both market
        power and efficiency effects.  The fact is that consumer surplus measures
        of losses underestimate consumer damages, often considerably, while producer
        surplus (profits) measures generally do not. This is because economic efficiency
        requires that losses be weighed more than gains. This result suggests that
        the optimal antitrust penalty as suggested by Landes and Posner is an underestimate.
        I show further that the concept of economic efficiency furnishes a justification
        for a focus on consumer protection as the correct role for antitrust law.
        This justification is related to the underestimates of consumer losses.  The
        gain-loss disparity suggests a rationale in antitrust law for the emphasis
        on consumer protection rather than using a total surplus standard.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        Effects of the Home Bias in European Banks&#8217; Sovereign Debt Portfolios</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624906</link><description>We
        document that large European banks hold sovereign debt portfolios heavily
        biased toward domestic government debt. This bias is stronger if the sovereign
        is risky and shareholder rights are strong, as evidence of a risk-shifting
        explanation of the home bias. In addition, the bias is stronger if the sovereign
        is risky and the government has positive ownership in the bank, as evidence
        of a government pressure channel. The home bias is positively valued by the
        stock market, as reflected by a positive association between the home bias
        and Tobin&#8217;s q. The home bias premium declines with domestic sovereign
        risk, but less so for highly leveraged banks, suggesting that both the risk-shifting
        and government pressure channels are operative. The European Central Bank&#8217;s
        large injections of liquidity in December 2011 and February 2012 reduced the
        marginal value of the home bias by allowing banks to expand their exposure
        to domestic government debt.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:55:06

        aim of this chapter is to interrogate what, if anything, is gained by reformulating
        labour law as a field of reflexive law and governance. The tradition of Oxford
        labour law scholarship stretching back to Kahn-Freund has not of course typically
        deployed the terminology of &#8216;reflexive law&#8217;, though it has been
        preoccupied &#8212; as reflexive law scholarship is &#8212; with labour law&#8217;s
        regulatory techniques. At its simplest, the reflexive turn in labour law is
        an attempt to speak to concerns about the effectiveness of the traditional
        regulatory techniques of labour legislation and administrative regulation
        in the context of changes in the institutional landscape, and changes to regulatory
        objectives in the areas of industrial relations and social policy.What has
        changed since the heyday of, respectively, collective laissez-faire and statutory
        intervention, as the dominant techniques of labour market regulation, and
        how convincing is &#8216;reflexive law&#8217; in its attempt to explain or
        rationalise the new forms of governance or law-making within the UK labour
        market, and more generally with reference to the social and employment policy
        of the European Union (EU)? This requires a three-fold investigation: first
        is reflexive law descriptively an appropriate means by which to understand
        the range of regulatory techniques being adopted across the field of employment
        and industrial relations: how accurate a description of regulatory change
        are theories of reflexive law, or related discourses of &#8216;responsive&#8217;,
        &#8216;new&#8217; or &#8216;experimentalist&#8217; governance? Second, is
        it right, normatively, to adopt or advocate a reflexive approach to regulation,
        to the extent that such an approach may well eschew a substantive content
        for labour law? Can a reflexive approach be inherently &#8216;neutral&#8217;
        as to (regulatory or labour market) outcomes? What of those criticisms of
        reflexive regulation which contend that the rise of reflexive (labour) law
        runs in parallel to and indeed reinforces the neoliberal turn in economic
        policy making? Third, is there empirical evidence to show that a reflexive
        approach to regulation works in practice? Is it true to claim &#8212; as theorists
        of reflexive law, responsive regulation or new governance do &#8212; that
        regulatory interventions in the labour market are more likely to be successful
        in achieving their objectives if they avoid direct prescription of substantive
        social or distributive outcomes, and instead engage in what one might call
        &#8216;second-order&#8217; regulation by creating frameworks within which
        social actors such as employers can negotiate?</description><pubDate>Fri,

        in the Dynamic Public Goods Game</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625097</link><description>This
        paper studies the impact of inequity aversion preferences (Fehr and Schmidt,
        1999) in a "repeated" public goods game. We assume that agents care about
        the expected payoff differences among themselves over all periods of a game,
        so that it is in fact a dynamic game that is being played. In such a game,
        not only do inequity-averse agents cooperate on equal and nearly efficient
        levels of contribution to the public goods, but also could selfish agents
        make active contributions. These results are robust to asymmetric information
        about agents&#8217; types. Our findings also correspond to the end-game effect,
        the restart effect and a pulsing behavior that are often observed in experiments.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        use a sovereign default model to study the effects of introducing limits to
        the decision-making capabilities of governments-fiscal rules. We show that
        optimal limits to the debt level vary greatly across parameterizations of
        the model that deliver different levels of debt tolerance. In contrast, optimal
        limits to the sovereign premium paid by the government are very similar across
        parameterizations. Since levels of debt tolerance are difficult to identify
        and vary both across countries and over time, and political constraints often

        the Difference Matter? An Interdisciplinary View from the UK</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625181</link><description>In
        the wake of the Snowden revelations, it has become standard practice to rely
        upon the dichotomies metadata/data or metadata/content of communications to
        delineate the remit of the surveillance and investigation power of law enforcement
        agencies as well as the range of data retention obligations imposed upon telecommunications
        operators and in particular Internet service providers (ISPs). There is however
        no consensual definition of what metadata is and different routes can be taken
        to describe what metadata really covers. The key question is whether or to
        which extent metadata should be treated akin to content data for the purposes
        of identifying the categories of data which shall actually be retained by
        telecommunications operators and to which law enforcement agencies can have
        access. In an attempt to answer the question, this paper provides an understanding
        of what metadata is and what their diversity is by following two steps. First,
        adopting an interdisciplinary approach, we argue that three types of metadata
        should be distinguished in relation to the nature of the activity of the service
        provider processing them and their level in a network communications - network-level,
        application-level metadata, and service-use metadata - and we identify three
        types of criteria to classify these metadata and determine whether they should
        be deemed as akin to content data. Second, we compare these categories with
        legal concepts and in particular UK legal concepts to assess to which extent
        law-makers have managed to treat content data and metadata differently.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        Term Yield Curve Model</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625185</link><description>This
        paper describes the development and initial testing of the Black-corrected
        version of a workhorse 3-factor Gaussian yield curve (term structure) model,
        the economic factor model (Dempsteret al., 2010) which we have used for many
        years with Monte Carlo scenario simulation for structured derivative valuation,
        investment modelling and asset liability management with various time steps
        and currencies. In common with most alternative approaches in the literature
        to generating non-negative yieldsusing Black''s idea, we propose a simple
        approximation to the Black mathematical model using the nonlinear unscented
        Kalman filter (UKF). However, model calibration, unlike that of the current
        computationally intensive alternatives, requires not significantly more computing
        time than is needed for the linear Kalman filter with the underlying affine
        shadow rate model. Initial empirical testing of the new Black EFM model both
        in- and out-of-sampleshows acceptable accuracy, improved over that of the
        affine EFM model, which can be further improved by UKF tuning in future research.
        Migration of the system to the cloud can reduce calibration times for both
        models from a few hours to a few minutes by exploiting massive parallelization
        of the computationally intensive step.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015

        article introduces to legal scholarship the first sustained discussion of
        prison abolition and what I will call a &#8220;prison abolitionist ethic.&#8221;
        Prisons and punitive policing produce tremendous brutality, violence, racial
        stratification, ideological rigidity, despair, and waste. Meanwhile, incarceration
        and prison-backed policing neither redress nor repair the very sorts of harms
        they are supposed to address &#8212; interpersonal violence, addiction, mental
        illness, and sexual abuse, among others. Yet despite persistent and increasing
        recognition of the deep problems that attend U.S. incarceration and prison-backed
        policing, criminal law scholarship has largely failed to consider how the
        goals of criminal law &#8212; principally deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation,
        and retributive justice &#8212; might be pursued by means entirely apart from
        criminal law enforcement. Abandoning prison-backed punishment and punitive
        policing remains generally unfathomable. This article argues that the general
        reluctance to engage seriously an abolitionist framework represents a failure
        of moral, legal, and political imagination. If abolition is understood to
        entail simply the immediate tearing down of all prison walls, then it is easy
        to dismiss abolition as unthinkable. But if abolition consists instead of
        an aspirational ethic and a framework of gradual decarceration, which entails
        a positive substitution of other regulatory forms for criminal regulation,
        then the inattention to abolition in criminal law scholarship and reformist
        discourse comes into focus as a more troubling absence. Although violent crime
        prevention and proportional punishment of wrongdoing purportedly justify imprisonment,
        this article illuminates how the ends of criminal law might be accomplished
        in large measure through institutions aside from criminal law administration.
        More specifically, this article explores a form of grounded preventive justice
        neglected in existing scholarly, legal, and policy accounts. Grounded preventive
        justice offers a positive substitutive account of abolition that aims to displace
        criminal law enforcement through meaningful justice reinvestment to strengthen
        the social arm of the state and improve human welfare. This positive substitutive
        abolitionist framework would operate by expanding social projects to prevent
        the need for carceral responses, decriminalizing less serious infractions,
        improving the design of spaces and products to reduce opportunities for offending,
        redeveloping and &#8220;greening&#8221; urban spaces, proliferating restorative
        forms of redress, and creating both safe harbors for individuals at risk of
        or fleeing violence and alternative livelihoods for persons subject to criminal
        law enforcement. By exploring prison abolition and grounded preventive justice
        in tandem, this article offers a positive ethical, legal, and institutional
        framework for conceptualizing abolition, crime prevention, and grounded justice
        together.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:56:54 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Hidden
        Champions or Black Sheep? Evidence from German Mini-Bonds</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625224</link><description>This
        paper presents a first empirical examination of all available German mini-bond
        offerings between 2010 and 2015. We compare the default probability according
        to a mini-bond&#8217;s initial rating with that implied by credit risk models,
        and show that rating agencies can create ratings inflation by issuing overly
        favorable ratings. This creates a &#8220;window of opportunity&#8221; for
        lower-quality firms to compete for funding. In this environment, high-quality
        firms have an incentive to use mini-bond underpricing to signal their quality.
        Our data highlight that, according to information-based corporate finance
        theory, higher underpricing is correlated with higher-quality mini-bond issuers
        and lower early default rates.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:55:46

        Laws</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625235</link><description>The
        provision of the Irish Constitution that guarantees &#8220;the unborn&#8221;
        a right to life equal to that of a pregnant woman has consequences for access
        to abortion and the care of women in pregnancy generally. Long-awaited legislation
        to give effect to the narrow constitutional right to abortion was enacted
        into law in 2013. In 2014, a guidance document for health professionals&#8217;
        implementation of the legislation was published. However, the legislation
        and guidance document fall far short of international human rights bodies&#8217;
        recommendations: they fail to deliver effective procedural rights to all of
        the women eligible for lawful abortion within the state and create new legal
        barriers to women&#8217;s reproductive rights. At the same time, cases continue
        to highlight that the Irish Constitution imposes an unethical and rights-violating
        legal regime in non-abortion-related contexts. Recent developments suggest
        that both the failure to put guidelines in place and the development of guidelines
        that are not centered on women or based on rights further reduce women&#8217;s
        access to rights and set unacceptable limitations on women&#8217;s reproductive
        autonomy. Nevertheless, public and parliamentary scrutiny of cases involving
        Ireland&#8217;s abortion laws is increasingly focusing on the need for reform.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        FDA and Antitrust Courts Undermine the Hatch-Waxman Act to Avoid Dealing with
        Patents</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625240</link><description>Under
        the Hatch-Waxman Act, patent law and FDA regulation work together to determine
        the timing of generic entry in the market for drugs. But FDA has sought to
        avoid any responsibility for reading patents, insisting that its role in administering
        the patent provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act is purely ministerial. This
        gap in regulatory oversight has allowed innovators to use irrelevant patents
        to defer generic competition. Meanwhile, patent litigation has set the stage
        for anticompetitive settlements rather than adjudication of the patent issues
        in the courts. As these settlements have provoked antitrust litigation, antitrust
        courts have proven no more willing than FDA to address the merits of the underlying
        patent infringement actions, preferring to rely on misleading proxies such
        as the existence of a &#8220;reverse payment&#8221; in the settlement agreement.
        Antitrust litigation is, at best, a belated and awkward mechanism for correcting
        the effects of improperly delayed generic entry. But FDA is well-positioned
        to make timely determinations of which patents meet the statutory criteria
        for deferring generic entry. With proper staffing and resources, FDA could
        use its expertise in drug regulation to make rough assessments of the relationship
        between particular patents and the scope of FDA approval in NDAs and ANDAs
        quickly and cheaply, while leaving patent infringement remedies intact. Only
        those patents that FDA decides could reasonably be asserted against an unauthorized
        generic would lead FDA to stay approval of the generic pending litigation
        of the infringement action. The result would be a reduction in incentives
        to pursue dubious patent infringement claims, with a corresponding reduction
        in opportunities for anti-competitive settlements.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        Ratio Pricing of SMB, HML and UMD Exposure in U.S. Equity Mutual Funds</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625247</link><description>The
        expense ratio price of U.S. equity market exposure is close to zero with funds
        like Vanguard&#8217;s Total Stock Market Index (ticker: VTSAX) charging an
        expense ratio of just 5 bps. An interesting, and more difficult, question
        to answer: How much are mutual fund companies charging investors to gain exposure
        to small-cap, value and positive momentum stocks? This is more difficult to
        answer because a fund that calls itself &#8220;small-cap&#8221; may own stocks
        that are materially smaller than another fund that also has &#8220;small-cap&#8221;
        in its title. The same is true for funds with the word &#8220;value&#8221;
        in their names. We answer this question using monthly returns data for low-cost
        mutual funds and ETFs in tandem with Fama-French three- and Carhart four-factor
        equity pricing models and current fund expense ratio levels. We indeed find
        strong evidence that fund companies charge for exposure to individual factor
        premiums. Additionally, we find significant variation in how strongly factor
        exposure is priced, both across fund companies and across portfolios offering
        identical levels of factor premium exposure.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03

        the streets of Hong Kong to Ferguson, Missouri, civil disobedience has again
        become newsworthy. What explains the prevalence and extremity of acts of civil
        disobedience?This paper presents a model in which protest planners choose
        the nature of the disturbance hoping to influence voters (or other decision-makers
        in less democratic regimes) both through the size of the unrest and by generating
        a response. The model suggests that protesters will either choose a mild &#8220;epsilon&#8221;
        protest, such as a peaceful march, which serves mainly to signal the size
        of the disgruntled population, or a &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; protest, which
        is painful enough to generate a response but not painful enough so that an
        aggressive response is universally applauded. Since non-epsilon protests serve
        primarily to signal the leaders&#8217; type, they will occur either when protesters
        have private information about the leader&#8217;s type or when the distribution
        of voters&#8217; preferences are convex in a way that leads the revelation
        of uncertainty to increase the probability of regime change. The requirements
        needed for rational civil disobedience seem not to hold in many world settings,
        and so we explore ways in which bounded rationality by protesters, voters,
        and incumbent leaders can also explain civil disobedience.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        of the Duty to Settle: Perspectives from the American Law Institute Principles/Restatement
        Project on Liability Insurance</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625294</link><description>This
        paper addresses the standard of good faith to be applied to the duty to settle.
        All insurance policies contain an implied covenant of good faith and fair
        dealing. This implied covenant has been applied by U.S. courts to an implied
        duty to settle contained in most liability insurance policies. The implied
        duty to settle arises from the insurers&#8217; right to settle cases under
        terms of most liability policies. Because insurers have the duty to defend
        and the right to settle, courts have found that insurers have an obligation
        to act in good faith when considering a settlement offer within the policy
        limits of the liability insurance policy. The American Law Institute &#8220;restatement&#8221;
        project to restate the law of liability insurance explicitly adopts a test
        for the duty to settle that an insurer &#8220;has a duty to the insured to
        make reasonable settlement decisions,&#8221; and that a &#8220;reasonable
        settlement decision is one that would be made by a reasonable person that
        bears the sole financial responsibility for the full amount of the potential
        judgment&#8221;.  This standard is referred to as the Disregard the Limits
        (DTL) standard. This paper provides background on the DTR standard and will
        compare that standard to the Equal Consideration (EC) standard which requires
        that an insurer, in addressing settlement offers, give equal consideration
        to the interests of the insured as to its own interests. It will then situate
        Missouri law within the context of these two tests and the state of the law
        more generally.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:55:46 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>The
        Values at Stake in Screening Foreign Investment in New Zealand Land: A Legislative
        History in Three Acts</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625295</link><description>The
        Overseas Investment Act 2005 regulates the entry of foreign investment into
        New Zealand by screening investment proposals that fall within the Act&#8217;s
        definitions of &#8220;significant business assets&#8221; and &#8220;sensitive
        land&#8221;. Calls for reform or repeal of the Act which are aimed at facilitating
        foreign investment into New Zealand (rather than limiting it) tend to be based
        on economic rationales. The risk of reform driven exclusively by economic
        rationales is that non-economic interests and values could be undermined.
        By the same token, if the regulatory objectives are not purely economic in
        nature, but encompass core national values, then overseas experience suggests
        that the Act will be highly resistant to pressure to liberalize. The issue
        then is that as part of any review, the relevant values need to be identified
        and addressed. Recent literature tends to either assume the existence of non-economic
        issues arising from foreign ownership in land, or questions their existence,
        but in both cases without investigating further. A close analysis of the legislative
        history and public consultation on the legislation demonstrates that the protection
        of cultural and heritage values is and has always been an important objective
        of screening foreign investment, and that specific policy objectives include
        the recognition of the importance of rural land to national identity.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        offers protection to creative works, but new technologies put pressure on
        that protection. Copyright owners and technology firms negotiate over new
        ways of distributing and transmitting creative works. Understanding the shadow
        that copyright casts on private negotiations will allow policy makers to better
        design the statute in a way that encourages more competition, diversity, and
        transactional efficiency in markets for digital goods. Prime examples of copyright
        licensing negotiations are the attempts to license digital music services
        over the past decade. In this Article we present the first qualitative and
        quantitative data about the licensing process for on-demand music streaming
        services, gleaned from confidential interviews with executives and attorneys.
        We report our findings about the time it takes to license a nascent service,
        if negotiations succeed; the number of record labels and publishers with which
        new music services typically deal; the general processes through which these
        licenses evolve; and how changes in the law over the period may have affected
        the dynamics of these negotiations. We find that copyright law, alongside
        business practices and professional attitudes, sets complex background rules
        for these private licensing negotiations. Copyright shapes, constrains, and

        U.S. data for 1976-2013, this paper studies the effects of various macroeconomic
        variables, particularly the national debt, government budget deficits and
        taxes, on fertility decisions over the business cycle. A rise in the debt-GDP
        ratio, government spending-GDP ratio and the deficit-GDP ratio reduces fertility.
        On the other hand, a fall in the tax revenues-GDP ratio is associated with
        lower fertility rates. These results hold even after controlling for other
        potential determinants of fertility such as the female participation rate
        in the labor force, inflation rate, GDP growth rate, urbanization rate, female
        life expectancy, marriage rate and divorce rate. I then show that these findings
        can, to a large extent, be explained by an overlapping generations model with
        altruism, and that abstracting from altruism delivers results that are at

        Rates and Population</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625396</link><description>Recent
        papers consider the relationship between population growth and capital accumulation.
        In general the relationship is not monotonic; there is a tension between two
        opposing effects - a higher growth rate diluting capital that has already
        been accumulated, and the ability of a growing population to generate its
        own wealth. The strengths of these effects depends on the population structure
        and the time horizon for each generation to accumulate wealth.This type of
        analysis has been conducted within an Overlapping Generations framework. However
        an explicit assumption is needed to allow a comparative static analysis of
        levels of population growth and capital accumulation. That assumption is effectively
        the requirement for each generation to be self supporting in terms of its
        consumption and contribution to production.We show that this assumption can
        be justified in theory by a form of economic efficiency with respect to population
        changes, referred to as demographic efficiency. This analysis is also conducted
        within the Overlapping Generations model. Thus we provide necessary and sufficient
        conditions for such efficiency in terms of each generation&#8217;s lifetime
        consumption and contribution to production.The main result of this paper is
        that there must be an intimate relationship, under general conditions, between
        long term real interest rates and long term demographic trends.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        accounting practices in countries like India are still to catch up with management
        accounting practices in USA and other developed countries. The reason is that
        they do not face global competition. For example, Indian firms started facing

        only two decades back. As a result management accounting research is also
        scarce in India. Even now research in management accounting has not picked

        A persuasion mechanism consists of a family of conditional distributions over
        the underlying state space and the generated noisy signals. A biased, perfectly
        informed sender adopts a persuasion mechanism to provide a group of uninformed
        receivers with signals about the unknown state of the world. We compare public
        persuasion with private persuasion. We find that the sender can always reach
        her highest possible expected payoff under public persuasion, regardless of
        the number of signals or the signals'' correlation structure. The sender is
        worse off under private persuasion. Moreover, we show that private persuasion

        on the Consolidated Tape</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625401</link><description>All
        U.S. exchanges report trades based on non-marketable limit orders resting
        in the limit order book (LOB). Using ITCH data time stamped to the nanosecond,
        we show that this reporting convention typically results in arriving marketable
        orders (Orders) of a given size being reported as multiple trades of smaller
        size. We show that the size of Orders cannot be recovered using data sources
        time stamped to the millisecond such as the NYSE daily TAQ and the Consolidated
        Tape. Use of trades rather than Orders can substantially bias empirical applications
        such as estimates of the components of the spread.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        Under Double Tax Treaties</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625402</link><description>If
        interpreted in a strict legal sense, beneficial ownership rules in tax treaties
        would have no effect on conduit companies because companies at law own their
        property and income beneficially. Conversely, a company can never own anything
        in a substantive sense because economically a company is no more than a congeries
        of arrangements that represents the people behind it. Faced with these contradictory
        considerations, people have adopted surrogate tests that they attempt to employ
        in place of the treaty test of beneficial ownership. An example is that treaty
        benefits should be limited to companies that are both resident in the states
        that are parties to the treaty and that carry on substantive business activity.
        The test is inherently illogical. The origins of the substantive business
        activity test appear to lie in analogies drawn with straw company and base
        company cases. Because there is no necessary relationship between ownership
        and activity, the test of substantive business activity can never provide
        a coherent surrogate for the test of beneficial ownership. The article finishes
        with a Coda that summarises suggestions for reform to be made in work that

        Powers in WTO: A Cheap-Talk Game Under Different Communication Protocols</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625411</link><description>Official
        reports and case studies reveal that China experienced different means of
        communication with the world powers since it joined the World Trade Organization
        in 2001. In the first five years, China had public communication with both
        the United States and the European Union under the Transitional Review Mechanism.
        In 2006 a new means of communication, the China-US Strategic and Economic
        Dialogue, started to take effect. Reports show that the new mechanism has
        advanced the China-US relationship positively and productively. The difference
        between the two means of communication stimulates our study. We adopt a game
        theory model to examine the impact of different communication protocols on
        China''s incentives to reveal information. We analyze a cheap-talk game between
        an informed agent and two uninformed principals who coordinate actions under
        two communication protocols: public and private communication. First, all
        equilibria under both means of communication are characterized. Information
        precision of the agent''s equilibrium messages decreases with the principals''
        preference biases. Second, under private communication the agent communicates
        more informatively with one principal if she in effect reveals little information
        to the other. Under private communication there exists an informative equilibrium
        with asymmetric levels of information precision even when all equilibria under
        public communication are uninformative.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul

        jewel lock-up options, a common deal protection device during the 1980s mergers
        and acquisitions boom, are back.  During their popularity in the 1980s, these
        options took the form of agreements between a target company and a buyer pursuant
        to which the buyer was granted the right to purchase certain valuable assets,
        or crown jewels, of the target corporate family in the event the merger did
        not close.  After both state and federal courts questioned the validity of
        these lock-ups in the 1980s, lock-ups lost their luster and dealmakers stopped
        using them. But as the saying goes, &#8220;everything old becomes new again,&#8221;
        and crown jewel lock-ups have made a return in recent transactions.  This
        time around, dealmakers and have been quick to distinguish the modernized
        crown jewel lock-ups from their predecessors.  Although there has been limited
        case law addressing the validity of these lock-ups, courts appear more likely
        to uphold the lock-up if the lock-up can be attributed to a business purpose
        other than the merger and if the lock-up could be a standalone agreement,
        separate and apart from the merger.  This Article argues, however, that today&#8217;s
        lock-ups are not significantly different from their predecessors.  Practitioners
        and courts should not lose sight of the 1980s jurisprudence that closely scrutinized
        the sale process preceding the lock-up as well as the deterrent effects of
        the lock-up on potential bidders.  Failing to consider these factors and not
        giving these factors proper weight potentially results in companies and their
        shareholders being fleeced of their corporate family jewels and their value.  At
        the same time, however, dealmakers should not be as quick to shy away from
        lock-ups as they have done in the past. As the 1980s jurisprudence made clear,
        lock-ups can be used to enhance shareholder value. In particular, this Article
        argues that dealmakers may use lock-ups after an extensive sale process to
        incentivize bidders and extract additional value for shareholders.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        Private? Cheap-Talk Game with Interacting Decision-Makers</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625414</link><description>This
        paper examines the effect of interactions between heterogeneous decision-makers
        on an agent''s information revelation incentives. We analyze a cheap-talk
        game between an informed agent and two uninformed decision-makers who coordinate
        their actions. We compare public communication with private communication.
        In the latter environment, we find that the agent responds to the decision-makers''
        coordination by providing less precise information. For any partition equilibrium
        with the same number of partition elements, the agent faces much tighter incentive
        compatibility constraints under private than under public communication. Moreover,
        we rank the agent''s and the principals'' welfare over the two types of communication
        for equilibria with the same number of partition elements. We show, by a numerical
        example, that both the agent and the principals are better off under public
        communication. All players'' ex-ante expected utilities under public communication
        weakly dominate that under private communication even when the partition equilibria
        under each environment have the same level of information precision.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        paper investigates the role of persuasion mechanisms in collective decision-making.
        A biased sender adopts a Bayesian persuasion mechanism to provide a committee
        of uninformed receivers with signals about the unknown state of the world.
        We compare public persuasion with private persuasion. We find that the sender
        can always reach the concave closure of the set of possible expected payoffs
        under public persuasion, regardless of the number of generated signals. The
        sender is weakly worse off under private persuasion. We also provide conditions
        under which the receivers'' welfare from private persuasion dominates that
        from public persuasion. Moreover, voting fully aggregates receivers'' private
        information in the state where the sender and receivers'' preferences are
        perfectly aligned, while full information aggregation may fail in other states.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        disasters and climate change are interrelated macro-critical issues affecting
        all Pacific small states to varying degrees. In addition to their devastating
        human costs, these events damage growth prospects and worsen countries&#8217;
        fiscal positions. This is the first cross-country IMF study assessing the
        impact of natural disasters on growth in the Pacific islands as a group. A
        panel VAR analysis suggests that, for damage and losses equivalent to 1 percent
        of GDP, growth drops by 0.7 percentage point in the year of the disaster.
        We also find that, during 1980-2014, trend growth was 0.7 percentage point
        lower than it would have been without natural disasters. The paper also discusses

        Frameworks and Improving the Spending Mix in Small States</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625435</link><description>Reflecting
        diseconomies of scale in providing public goods and services, recurrent spending
        in small states typically represents a large share of GDP. For some small
        states, this limits the fiscal space available for growth-promoting capital
        spending. Small states generally face greater revenue volatility than other
        country groups, owing to their exposure to exogenous shocks (including natural
        disasters) and narrow production bases. With limited buffers, revenue volatility
        often results in procyclical fiscal policy as the econometric analysis shows.
        To strengthen fiscal frameworks, small states should seek to streamline and
        prioritize recurrent spending to create fiscal space for capital spending.
        The quality of spending could also be improved through public financial management
        reform and multiyear budgeting.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:56:00

        Martingale properties of the floating exchange rates of the ASEAN+3 region
        are analyzed in this study using contemporary (2000 to 2012) weekly data of
        inter-bank call rates. The main goal of the analysis is to see if informational
        efficiency is a feature floating (managed or independently floating) currencies
        in this coalition of countries still possess despite the current credit crisis
        and other economic shocks during the period. Employing relevant state-of-the-art
        econometric techniques, the study sets to empirically determine the presence
        of two important ingredients of informationally efficient market &#8211; the
        existence of the unit root component and the presence of uncorrelated increments
        within each exchange rate series. To address the unit root problem, a battery
        of tests catering to heterogeneous panel data is used while variance ratio
        tests robust to the occurrence of conditional volatilities are implemented.While
        the stylized facts and simple correlation analysis of the currencies and their
        one week holding period returns give initial evidence of market efficiencies,
        the various analytical tests and procedures implemented in the study provide
        compelling evidence on the existence of martingale properties of the FX series.
        Both the panel unit root and variance ratio tests uphold the validity of the
        efficient market hypothesis (EMH) in the participating currencies.The implication
        of this result is that despite the occurrence of perturbations due to economic
        shocks (e.g. the current credit crisis) the currencies of the region, which
        are currently pursuing unification, are riding the crises and exhibit informational
        efficiency.This may be considered a testament to the success of the on-going
        interregional monetary coordination and other multilateral initiatives of
        countries within the region aimed at crisis prevention and monetary policy
        synchronization.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:55:06 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Rozw&#243;j

        Unrestricted Immigration Compatible with Inclusive Welfare States? The (Un)Sustainability
        of EU Exceptionalism</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625486</link><description>The
        economist Milton Friedman was one of the first to argue that there is a fundamental
        tension between what he called "free immigration to jobs" and "free immigration
        to welfare" (Friedman 1978). The political scientist Gary Freeman made a similar
        point in his widely cited article on ''Migration and the political economy
        of the welfare state'', which concluded that "ultimately, national welfare
        states cannot coexist with the free movement of labor" (Freeman 1986). The
        implication of these arguments is that you can have large-scale labour immigration
        or an inclusive welfare state - but not both. However, under the ''free movement''
        rules of the European Union, EU workers have both the right to freely migrate
        and work in any EU member state and the right to full and equal access to
        that country''s welfare state. Does the experience of the EU show that the
        alleged tension between large-scale labour immigration and inclusive welfare
        states does not exist or, if it exists, that it can be overcome? Or will the
        free movement of workers within the EU prove to be unsustainable? In this
        paper I argue and show why continuing to insist on both unrestricted migration
        and equal access to national welfare states for EU workers has the potential
        to undermine the political sustainability of ''free movement'' because it
        does not take adequate account.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:55:06

        study explores the weak-form efficiency of the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE)

        robust statistical properties. The research is motivated by the lack of consensus
        in the literature on the informational efficiency of the country&#8217;s stock
        market and the apparent scarcity of studies on the same issue using data covering
        the period of massive modernization of the exchange, geared toward transparent
        disclosures and integrity of transactions. The study may also be considered
        a fitting assessment of why the PSE is setting the pace over most stock exchanges

        in a highly successful year 2012 when it ranked ninth among the ten best-performing

        assess the lifesaving effect of hospital proximity using data on fatality
        rates of road-traffic accidents. While most of the literature on this topic
        is based on changes in distance to the nearest hospital triggered by hospital
        closures and use OLS estimates, our identification comes from the exogenous
        variation in the proximity to cities that are allowed by law to have a hospital
        based on their population size. Our instrumental variable results, based on
        Italian municipalities data from 2000 to 2012, show that an increase by a
        standard deviation of distance to the nearest hospital (5 km) increases the
        fatality rate by 13.84% on the sample average. This is equal to a 0.92 additional
        death per every 100 accidents. We show that OLS estimates provide a downward
        biased measure of the real effect of hospital proximity because they do not
        fully solve spatial sorting problems. Proximity matters more when the road
        safety is low; the emergency service is not properly organized, and the nearest
        hospital has lower quality standards.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015

        use the results of the ECB''s Comprehensive Assessment to evaluate the importance
        of bank business model on risk assessment and the persuasive effectiveness
        of different supervisory styles on banks&#8217; recapitalization. Our analysis
        reveals inconsistencies in the information content provided by the various
        regulatory measures used for assessing bank stability. Moreover, opposite
        to the RWA density and CET1 ratio, the leverage ratio provides assessments
        on business models closer to a market-based measure of bank risk. We also
        find that the effectiveness of the supervisory action depends on the specific
        type of supervisory model. In particular, countries adopting the hybrid model
        are more severe and effective in persuading banks to recapitalize preventively.
        Differently, countries adopting the integrated and the sectorial model seem

        in Italy</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625503</link><description>This
        paper aims at investigating empirically the impact of fiscal decentralization
        reforms on inequality in well-being. In particular, we look at the effects
        on health inequalities following the assignment of larger tax power to the
        Italian Regions for financing their health expenditure, starting from the
        end of the Nineties. Exploiting large differences in the size of the tax base
        across Regions, we find that fiscal decentralization processes that attribute
        a greater tax power to lower government tiers, besides reducing inefficiencies
        of healthcare policies, seem to be effective in reducing also within-regional
        disparities in health outcomes. However, the degree of economic development
        &#8211; on which depends the actual fiscal autonomy from Central government
        &#8211; significantly affects the effectiveness of these reforms and highlights
        the importance to take properly into account the specific features of the
        context where the decentralization of power is implemented.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        the last few years, macroeconomic modelling has emphasised the role of credit
        market frictions in magnifying and transmitting nominal and real disturbances
        and their implication for macro-prudential policy design. In this paper, we
        construct a modest New Keynesian general equilibrium model with active banking
        sector. In this set-up, the financial sector interacts with the real side
        of the economy via firm balance sheet and bank capital conditions and their
        impact on investment and production decisions. We rely on the financial accelerator
        mechanism due to Bernanke et al. (1999) and combine it with a bank capital
        channel as demonstrated by Aguiar and Drumond (2007). We calibrate the resulting
        model from the perspective of a low income economy reflecting the existence
        of relatively high investment adjustment cost, strong fiscal dominance, and
        underdeveloped financial and capital markets where the central bank uses money
        growth in stabilizing the national economy. Then we examine the impulse response
        of selected endogenous variables to shocks stemming from the fiscal authority,
        the monetary policy process, and technological progress. The findings are
        broadly consistent with previous studies that demonstrated stronger role for
        credit market imperfections in amplifying and propagating monetary policy
        shocks. Moreover, we also compare the trajectory of the model economy under
        alternative monetary policy instruments. The results suggest that the model
        with money growth rule generates higher volatility in output and inflation
        than the one with interest rate rule.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015

        study examines the impact of CEO inside debt on earnings management. Theory
        predicts that CEOs with higher inside debt holdings adopt less risky corporate
        policies and choose investment policies that result in less volatile earnings.
        Under such circumstances, CEOs would face weaker demand for income smoothing.
        Consistent with these expectations, our results reveal that CEO inside debt
        is negatively associated with both accrual and real activities based earnings
        management. We also find that firms with higher levels of CEO inside debt
        are less likely to meet or slightly beat analysts&#8217; earnings forecasts.
        Further, the capital market response to positive earnings surprises is greater
        when CEOs hold higher positions of inside debt. Overall, our findings suggest
        that inside debt counteracts CEOs&#8217; incentives to smooth earnings through

        A Qualitative Analysis</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625519</link><description>The
        process used to select the hosts of the Olympic Games is under increased scrutiny
        due to the withdrawal of many cities from the 2022 Winter Olympic Games host
        selection process, and the selection of hosts with questionable human rights
        records. Scholarship, particularly legal scholarship, examining the hosting
        of the Olympic Games is rapidly increasing. Absent from much of this scholarship
        is a thorough examination of the host selection process. Understanding the
        host selection process is crucial when considering issues faced by host cities
        as many of the issues can be traced back to the host selection process.This
        Article examines the process used to select the hosts of the Olympic Games,
        focusing on legal issues addressed by the host selection process. A qualitative
        analysis of the questions asked by the IOC of cities that bid to host the
        Olympic Games, and their responses to those questions, is the core of this
        Article. The Article asks what the role of law is in the host selection process,
        and whether legal issues are integral to the selection of a host for the Olympic
        Games. The results of the qualitative analysis are used to frame future research
        for discussing reform of the host selection process, namely to include human
        rights protections.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:56:54 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>The
        Ambiguity Triangle: Uncovering Fundamental Patterns of Behavior Under Uncertainty</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625529</link><description>The
        probability triangle (also called the Marschak-Machina triangle) allows for
        compact and intuitive depictions of risk preferences. Here, we develop an
        analogous tool for choice under uncertainty - the ambiguity triangle - and
        show that indifference curves in this triangle capture preferences for unknown
        probabilities. In particular, the ambiguity triangle allows us to examine
        whether subjects adhere to the generalized axiom of revealed preference (GARP)
        and satisfy a non-parametric test for constant ambiguity attitudes. We find
        that more than 95% of subjects adhere to GARP and that about 60% satisfy our
        test for a constant ambiguity attitude. Yet, among these 60% of subjects there
        is substantial preference heterogeneity. We characterize this heterogeneity
        with finite-mixture estimates of a one-parameter extension of Expected Utility
        Theory wherein 48% of subjects are ambiguity averse, 22% are ambiguity seeking,
        and 30% are close to ambiguity neutral. The ambiguity triangle also highlights
        how variable ambiguity attitudes arise mainly because indifference curves
        are &#8217;fanning-in&#8217; across the triangle. This fanning-in property
        implies that aversion to ambiguity increases as the likelihood of receiving
        a good outcome increases. We capture this behavior with a simple parametric
        model that also allows for finite mixture characterizations of preference
        heterogeneity for these subjects. We show that for a substantial share of
        these subjects (43%) their fanning-in is so strong that, although they are
        initially ambiguity seeking, they become strongly ambiguity averse as the
        likelihood of receiving a good outcome increases.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        Companies for Human Rights Violations of Subsidiaries</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625536</link><description>The
        infringement of human rights by subsidiaries of multinational enterprises
        has become a thoroughly discussed topic. It is obvious that potential corporate
        liability under any regime gives incentives to group companies for structuring
        themselves in a way that, if ever agents who do not respect human right will
        be held responsible, the liability risks remain within the sphere of a foreign
        subsidiary. Looking from the perspective of the injured person, this strategy
        motivates to invoke veil-piercing, direct liability or forum-doctrines to
        tap the financial capability of the parent company. Following the UNGP the
        question arises what can be done to establish fair jurisdiction, suitable
        to hold negligent parent companies liable e.g. based on mandatory due diligence
        obligations in respect of the adherence to human rights.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        a continuous-time setting where a risk-averse agent controls the drift of
        an output process driven by a Brownian motion, optimal contracts are linear
        in the terminal output; this result is well-known in a setting with moral
        hazard and - under stronger assumptions - adverse selection. Using techniques
        from stochastic control theory, we show that this result continues to hold
        when in addition reservation utilities are type-dependent. This type of problem
        occurs in the study of optimal compensation problems involving competing principals.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        and Energy Efficiency in Spain</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625560</link><description>The
        residential building sector is a major driver of current and future energy
        consumption and associated emissions, which can be potentially mitigated through
        significant energy-efficiency (EE) improvements in both emerging and developed
        countries. Yet, there are several persistent barriers that hinder the attainment
        of EE improvements in this area. Using data from a 2008 national representative
        survey of Spanish households, this paper is interested in the determinants
        of EE-related decisions. In particular, a discrete-choice model empirically
        analyzes whether pro-environmental households are more likely to invest in
        EE and to adopt daily energy-saving habits. We show that households with eco-friendly
        behaviors are more likely to investment in well-differentiated EE measures
        as well as to steer daily habits towards energy savings. However, no effects
        are found for households with environmental attitudes based on stated willingness
        to pay to protect the environment. In addition to this, households belonging
        to higher income groups and education levels are more likely to invest in
        EE but not to adopt energy-saving habits; while households with older members
        are less likely to invest in EE and show fewer eco-friendly habits.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        for Energy Efficiency in the Residential Sector</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625564</link><description>In
        spite of the large potential and existing efforts to foster energy efficiency
        in the residential sector, much remains to be achieved. This may be partially
        due to the many barriers and market failures faced by energy efficiency, which
        are even greater in the residential sector. In particular, informational failures
        seem to be pervasive and relevant in this area. Addressing these issues requires
        specific policy instruments and strategies. This paper reviews the empirical
        evidence on the effectiveness of such instruments, focusing on energy certificates,
        feedback programs, and energy audits. Results show that energy certificates
        and feedback programs can be effective, but only if they are carefully designed.
        Yet energy audits seem to have little effect on efficiency. In addition, the
        paper points out the large potential for new instruments as well as combinations
        of existing ones.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:57:43 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Outside

        Information and Sovereign Wealth Fund Investment</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625902</link><description>This
        paper investigates the effect of sovereign wealth fund (SWF ) investments
        on the performance of target firms through a liquidity channel. We test whether
        the additional information asymmetry from SWF investment causes target firm
        liquidity to decrease in the medium to long term and whether the decrease
        in target liquidity creates downward pressure on target firm valuation. Overall,
        our results suggest that the medium to long-term performance of SWF target
        firms is driven by two opposing factors. On the one hand, we find strong evidence
        for uncompensated reduction in stock liquidity in the medium to long-term
        subsequent to SWF investment. We conjecture this to be a consequence of SWFs''
        intractability in terms of investing objectives, which potentially include
        both financial and non-financial motives. On the other hand, we find evidence
        that SWFs improve firm performance, especially for more financially distressed
        firms. This is a result of SWF monitoring and certification. The net effect
        of the two opposite forces is the uncertainty in the performance of SWF target
        firms.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:55:06 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>US
        Inflation Dynamics on Long Range Data</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625904</link><description>In
        this paper we evaluate inflation persistence in the U.S. using long range
        monthly and annual data. The importance of inflation persistence is crucial
        to policy authorities and market participants, since the level of inflation
        persistence provides an indication on the susceptibility of the economy to
        exogenous shocks. Departing from classic econometric approaches found in the
        relevant literature, we evaluate inflation persistence through the nonparametric
        Hurst exponent within both a global and a rolling window framework. Moreover,
        we expand our analysis to detect the potential existence of chaos in the data
        generating process, in order to enhance the robustness of our conclusions.
        Overall, we find that inflation persistence is high from 1775 to 2013 for
        the annual dataset and from February 1876 to May 2014 in monthly frequency,
        respectively. Especially from the monthly dataset, the rolling window approach
        allows us to derive that inflation persistence has reached to historically
        high levels in the post Bretton Woods period and remained there ever since.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        Razzaque (2009) analyzes the effects of gender on the Ultimatum Game in Pakistan.
        A more detailed analysis of the data set reveals several additional insights
        that are not discussed in the original publication. While we confirm Rezzaque
        (2009) finding that cultural effects lead to significantly different gender
        related behavior in Pakistan. Contrary to most of existing literature, female
        proposers offered significantly smaller amounts than male proposers. Additionally,
        we show that behavior of gender differ significantly with urbanity at least
        initially. Similarly two observations of Razzaque (2009) were not supported
        with the detailed data analysis. First, Razzaque (2009) associated learning
        effect to female respondents only. A close data analysis, however reveal strong
        learning effect resulting from rejected offers in initial periods. Second,  Razzaque
        (2009) concludes stronger response from male participants after gender revelation.
        Our data analyses indicate same degree of deviations from average offers for
        both male and female participants.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015

        Voting</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625926</link><description>We
        explore Time-Phased Voting (&#8220;TPV&#8221;), an arrangement in which long-term
        shareholders receive more votes per share than short-term shareholders.  TPV
        has gained prominence in recent years as a proposed remedy for perceived corporate
        myopia.  We begin with theory, situating TPV relative to other corporate voting
        structures such as one-share-one-vote and dual-class stock.  By decreasing
        the influence of short-term shareholders, TPV may encourage managers to act
        in the long-term interests of their firms.  It may also facilitate controlling
        shareholder diversification and firm equity issuances by enabling controlling
        shareholders, who are generally long-term shareholders, to maintain their
        control with lower levels of ownership.  In this respect, it resembles a milder
        form of dual-class stock, but is more targeted toward myopic behavior.  We
        then investigate U.S. companies&#8217; experiences with TPV in practice.  Due
        to limited U.S. experience with TPV, our sample size is small from a statistical
        standpoint.  Nevertheless, our findings are consistent with our theoretical
        analysis.  Our ownership and voting data suggest that TPV empowers long-term
        shareholders, but that it does little to encourage long-term shareholding;
        this may be due to a lack of investor awareness regarding the few companies
        that have TPV.  In the short term, TPV empowers insiders, increasing their
        control and creating a wedge between their ownership and control of the firm
        (though a smaller wedge than is typical of dual-class firms).  However, in
        the long term we find that TPV is associated with reduced insider ownership
        and control.  We see a transition in TPV companies, which are mainly mature,
        family-owned companies, from a concentrated to a more dispersed ownership
        structure.  Relatedly, we find that TPV is associated with significant insider
        diversification and the issuance of additional equity.  Overall, TPV firms
        significantly outperformed the market as a whole; an investor who invested
        in our TPV firm index in 1980 would have more than six times as much money
        at the end of 2013 as an investor who invested in the S&amp;P; 500.  While
        it is not clear that TPV contributed to this strong performance, we believe
        that shareholders and corporations should be free to experiment with reasonable
        TPV plans if they so choose.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:55:46

        are limited. Needs are unlimited. In such a scenario where the resources are
        not enough even to fulfill peoples&#8217; needs, let alone greeds, India,
        with it&#8217;s ever increasing population and ever increasing wants, needs
        to ensure a perfect and suitable mechanism for distribution of it&#8217;s
        resources so that all the strata and sections of the society, get their fair
        share of it. This fundamental theory of economics is the basis on which the
        entire and the basic foundation of administrative law has been built upon.The
        important question which arises in such a situation is who is to distribute
        such resources? On what basis, are such limited resources distributed? Is
        it the purchasing or buying capacity that decides their share in such resources
        or does such distribution take place equally among all the citizens irrespective
        of their purchasing power. Thus the basic question that needs to be answered
        here is whether the form of society is capitalistic or socialistic?This is
        where, the state or the government comes into picture. These activities that
        the state performs, for the protection and promotion of the economic and social
        well-being of its citizens are known as social welfare activities  and that
        such a state is known as the social welfare state. This article aims to bring
        about an insight into the facets of administrative law that deal with such
        models of the government. The level of interference that the state has had,
        over the individual and the resources has been changing over time and this
        change has led to the transition from the laissez faire form of society to
        the social welfare state. Another important aspect that the article deals
        with, is how the Constitution or in specific the Directive Principles of State
        Policy envisage or postulate the goal of a welfare state. In addition the
        article also deals with in detail, the criticisms with respect to both laissez
        faire and social welfare system of society. It is also essential for us to
        emphasize  and appreciate, the various functions  that the state undertakes
        to make sure that the country is governed in an efficient and effective manner.
        A detailed study of the same helps us in understanding the various terms and
        aspects that led to the development of the term &#8216;Administrative Law&#8217;.
        Also highlighted, by the way of an illustration are the pros and cons of such
        a welfare state and whether the social welfare structure followed in India
        is a feasible, viable and practical option for it.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        preferences and third-party enforcement of formal contracts are two mechanisms
        that facilitate performance of an agreement. The standard argument is that
        formal contracting substitutes when social preferences are lacking. We explore
        the hypothesis that social preferences and contract enforcement are complements.
        We measure social preferences from a Trust Game and use it is an explanatory
        variable in a contract game. We find that both increased contract enforcement
        and high trusting preferences lead to enhanced rates of contract formation
        and larger investments. There is an interaction effect where trusting individuals
        make larger investment agreements, specifically when enforcement is greater.
        Thus, contracts and social preferences complement one another.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        discussions to solve the problem of defining violence, to agree on some important
        aspects of the new manifestations of violence. From the perspective of sustainable
        development, resolving a crisis should not cause additional sizable crises
        than the existing ones, but to solve the existing crisis. Considering these
        aspects, this work shows how violence manifests itself in contemporary society
        and its impact on sustainable development. There are presented certain forms
        of violence &#8211; physical, criminal, anomic, collective, interpersonal
        &#8211; and risks involved. Based on the risk factors described in the last

        programs. They must be adapted to each type of offense: interpersonal violence,
        collective violence, anomic violence, violence against the environment; and  aim
        to reduce risk factors identified at the individual, family, school, friends
        or group in the community and society. At the same time, the programs developed
        for each type of crime should target both situational prevention actions and
        adoption of social prevention strategies including preventive action by development
        (aimed at child and family) and community preventive actions (in district

        subjects are more likely to ignore others'' payoffs, thus transforming games
        effectively into non-strategic decision situations. At least for our selection
        of strategic interactions this behavior is adaptive in the sense that there
        were no significant payoff losses resulting from the change in behavior. We
        use Bayesian latent class modeling to estimate the frequency of heuristic
        use or types in the subject pool conditional on time constraints. Under time
        pressure, we observe an increase in the proportion of non-strategic types
        (particularly Level-1) at the cost of other strategic heuristics including
        Nash equilibrium choices.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2015 12:53:04

        this paper will discuss the current state-of-the-art methodology in this area.  The
        paper will conclude that if one has an economic understanding of the source
        of an investment&#8217;s returns, then the investor is likely in a good position
        to decide whether its risks, however they are defined, are appropriate for

        in the Aftermath of Natural Disasters</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2623639</link><description>Prior
        studies on the impact of catastrophes on insurance markets have either focused
        on one specific type of hazard or pooled several natural disasters. We argue
        that insurers evaluate disaster risk not solely with respect to frequency
        and severity but pay attention to the disaster type. We analyze U.S. property
        insurers&#8217; supply decisions between 1992 and 2012 and find that insurers&#8217;
        responses with respect to reduction of business volume and exit decisions
        differ across hazards, even after controlling for the damage size. The negative
        effects of catastrophes on supply decisions are more pronounced after extreme
        hurricane years compared to tornado years. We argue that supply distortions
        in the aftermath of unprecedented catastrophes are driven primarily by correlated
        losses. Our results show that the size and predictability of catastrophe losses
        pose less severe threats to insurers. Thus, we propose that first of all insurers
        and regulators should focus on measures that encourage diversification.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        and Toleration in Religiously Diverse Societies: For Whom and for What?</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2623661</link><description>In
        this paper I analyze and criticize the approach of pluralist and tolerationist
        theories to religious diversity in action. Following a discussion on actionable
        pluralist and toleration theories for religiously diverse societies &#8211;
        represented by two interfaith programs, IFYC (Interfaith Youth Core) and CEDAR
        (Communities Engaging with Difference and Religion) &#8211; I take up several
        issues that Lauren Kerby touched upon in a CEDAR Occasional Paper (2013) in
        order to analyze three aspects of the topic: (1) rules of behavior and dialogue
        exchange among people of different religions, or no religion at all, in diverse
        societies &#8211; an issue exemplified by the stance which actionable pluralist
        and toleration theories take toward ; (2) the way in which a religious-identity&#8211;based
        approach toward tolerance-building in diverse societies can function as a
        method for effectively &#8220;working the toleration out of its job&#8221;
        and getting rid of &#8220;others&#8221; &#8211; a consequence that an actionable
        toleration approach such as CEDAR''s attempts to prevent through rules of
        sticking together; and (3) the respective merits and deficiencies of actionable
        pluralist and toleration theories as recipes for organizing life in religiously
        diverse societies. Ultimately, actionable pluralist and toleration theories
        turn out to be two equally valid approaches for different places, following
        the concept of &#8220;different strokes for different folks.&#8221; The actionable
        pluralist approach promises a better future life for everyone in exchange
        for the (largely voluntary) dilution of individuals&#8217; strongly held,
        action-oriented religious imperative. Yet actionable pluralist theories explicitly
        and implicitly benefit from historical foundations that are no longer not
        present in most parts of the world and exclusionary actions that are no longer
        easily viable. The greatest deficiency of the actionable toleration approach
        as a medicine for religiously diverse societies, on the other hand, appears
        to be that its proposed way of living in a diverse society cannot provide
        reasons for its inhabitants to affirm that the society they live in is fundamentally
        just, for reasons unrelated to any one particular group of people. Actionable
        toleration theory thus appears a somewhat unattractive and unrealistic option,
        for people have a real need to affirm that the society they inhabit is good
        &#8211; not because it is theirs, but because it is &#8220;objectively&#8221;
        good &#8211; and that need (even if mythical) will not be talked out of existence
        because it is unattainable or even irrational, let alone because identities
        and values are incommensurable. Hence, actionable toleration theories have
        to find a way to deal with the human need for the affirmation of a just society
        beyond particular identities. Shared deficiency of the actionable toleration
        approach and, to a lesser extent, actionable pluralist theory, is that basing
        toleration on arguments flowing from religious identity can lead toward &#8220;working
        the toleration out if its job,&#8221; since unflinching toleration destroys
        the basis of toleration itself, rendering it meaningless. It results in various
        forms and degrees of seclusion and separation. In contemporary religiously
        diverse societies, somewhat paradoxically, the support and respect of differences
        among religious identities turns out to be a strategic tool used by those
        who would like to eradicate many such differences.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        ''Moderately Successful'' Pro-Active Progressive Value Realisation</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624235</link><description>The
        success of ERPs installations (Enterprise Resource Planning) is a strongly
        debated subject. The average outcome of ERP projects seems to be &#8220;moderately
        successful&#8221;. This leaves room for improvement. The question is: how
        do the companies organise the improvement and evolution of their ERP in the
        most efficient manner?For most organisations, another big installation project
        is out of question and the ticket-based approach is designed to deliver repairs,
        not improvements. Combining a review of articles published on the subject
        and practical lessons learned on numerous projects, the author proposes a
        third, novel, way: The pro-Active progressive value realisation (P2VR).  P2VR
        solution design relies on a mix of training, IT system, business process and
        organizational changes. It leverages the system understanding of business
        people to identify optimal trade-offs as well as opportunities. It takes advantage
        from the fact that ERP can be modified with literally a few clicks. P2VR explicitly
        trades time for money, using a small team of experts and decision makers.P2VR
        projects follow a &#8220;climbing route&#8221; to deliver, from the onset,
        a permanent, structured, stream of improvements. The steady flow of good news
        enhances the standing of the IT function within the company.The specific advantages
        of the P2VR can be seen on both the input and output side. It lowers external
        costs as well as optimizes use of internal resources. It creates a constant
        stream of benefits that improves the ROI and enhances the reputation of the
        IT department.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:57:45 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>An
        Evaluation of Earnings Management Measures and Improvements of the Best Measure
        Found</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624290</link><description>Using
        a nonparametric method, this study evaluates the performance of upward earnings
        management measures. The first major finding is that positive discretionary
        accruals are not good upward earnings management measures because at least
        40 percent of the manipulators have negative discretionary accruals, and the
        earnings management group and the control group have similar proportions of
        positive discretionary accruals. Total accruals and changes in total accruals
        have worse performance. The second major finding is that unsigned accruals
        measures are positively related to upward earnings management risk. The unsigned
        discretionary accruals measure from the modified Jones model outperforms the
        others evaluated. After the modified Jones model is estimated by each fiscal
        year and the outliers are treated using nearest-neighbor cleaning approach,
        the highest three deciles of the measure have upward earnings management risk
        almost three times of that in the lowest three deciles, so the measure can
        help practitioners screen firm-years that have higher upward earnings management
        risk. However, the findings in this study discourage traditional modeling
        practice that uses discretionary accruals or unsigned discretionary accruals
        as a proxy for earning management to find earning management determinants.
        A new model framework for future earnings management research is suggested.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        Minorities</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624396</link><description>This
        Note examines what may be the most radical challenge posed by religious subcultures
        to the liberal politics of modern industrial nations - that of isolationist,
        nonliberal (or even illiberal) religious minorities. These subcultures do
        not seek to integrate with mainstream society or gain power within it, but
        to withdraw in order to maintain norms widely discrepant from those that are
        socially dominant. They often seek to place restrictions upon their own members''
        freedom or activities, in part to maintain the group''s differences from the
        greater society. These cultures, characterized by features as distinctive
        as collective property ownership, pacificism, and the rejection of the separation
        of church and state, pose a serious challenge to liberalism''s self-understanding
        and the norms of liberal tolerance.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015

        Actors and States In International Law: Introduction</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624567</link><description>There
        exists a range of situations where non-state actors and states can possibly
        share responsibility for their contribution to harmful outcomes, thereby raising
        a multitude of questions on the determination, content and implementation
        of responsibility in such a scenario. It may be tempting to adopt an approach
        whereby a shared responsibility regime involving non-state actors and states
        draws ex post on the regime put in place by the ILC Articles on Responsibility
        of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, especially in connection to the
        rules of attribution of conduct and attribution of responsibility. Such a
        model of international responsibility, however, would only work to the extent
        that addressees are bound by primary norms of international law in the first
        place. This is certainly not a given in respect of non-state actors. Moreover,
        non-state actors may differ fundamentally from states, thereby making the
        transposition of traditional rules of state responsibility artificial and
        inadequate: their loosely organised, temporary, diverse, illegitimate, or
        even outright criminal character may militate against applying the classic
        responsibility paradigm to non-state-state interactions. In view of these
        limitations, a turn to an ex ante approach to questions of shared responsibility,
        through standard-setting, has been suggested, and may be cautiously supported
        in respect of the activities of a number of non-state actors. This, however,
        is not exclusive to the simultaneous application of ex post and ex ante approaches
        to shared responsibility.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:57:09

        Extradition Allegations Part I</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624589</link><description>On
        April 14, 2015 Samir Azizi, a 25 year old German/Afghan citizen, was extradited
        from the United States to Germany.  The Extradition Compliant alleged (in
        89 criminal counts) that Azizi had denied the German Treasury &#8364;61,104,368
        in VAT revenue with 12 distinct Missing Trader Intra-Community (MTIC) fraud
        schemes.  At the time of arrest the 26 year old Azizi admitted that his involvement
        in MTIC frauds stretched back even before 2008, the initial reference year
        of the Complaint.  This paper assesses the Azizi extradition in two parts.  The
        first part considers the first 26 criminal counts, representing alleged VAT
        losses of &#8364;15,302,965 from four MTIC schemes.  The second part considers
        the remaining &#8364;45,801,403, in 63 criminal counts involving an additional
        8 companies.  Underlying both parts of this assessment is a fundamental (but
        unanswered) question: &#8220;Who exactly is Samir Azizi?  Is he the mastermind
        of a multi-million euro VAT fraud, a fundraising fraudster for terrorist organizations,
        or a youthful face of convenience used to disguise the intentions and involvement
        of a larger criminal organization?&#8221; The most troubling aspect of this
        case (more troubling than the financial losses) are the further allegation
        that is underscored by Judge Howard R. Lloyd in his Extradition Order that
        &#8220;&#8230; there were also indicators that perpetrators were using the
        VAT procured through such fraud, not only for personal enrichment, but also
        to finance terrorism.&#8221;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:56:55

        To evaluate consequences of corruption crime in the Republic of Belarus based
        on the official figures of statistics.Methods: The study being implemented
        is grounded on the universe dialectical method of perception making possible
        to investigate social phenomena in their interrelation and general scientific
        methods based thereon.Results: The main social-demographic characteristics
        of the corruption- crime victims in the Republic of Belarus are disclosed.Scientific
        Novelty: For the first time ever in criminology science the given work investigates
        the issues of victim monitoring in corruption crime statistics based on the
        figures submitted by the appropriate authorities in the Republic of Belarus.In
        consequence of victimization measurement of corruption crime in the Republic
        of Belarus it has emerged that most of corruption crime victims are accounted
        for corruptive embezzlements, abusive exercise of power or misuse of authority.
        A good number of physical persons become victims of  authority transgression
        or bribery but victims of failure to use authority appear to be just a few.In
        the Republic of Belarus victims of corruption crime mainly become its citizens
        and the share of foreigners in the total structure of victims is insignificant.
        The practical relevance of the given study lies in the fact that monitoring
        of corruption crime consequences in the Republic of Belarus can be used at
        working out the measures of the given crime victimization prophylaxis.The
        results received within the given study can be also used for the process of

        When Estimating Abnormal Returns and Systematic Risk of Private Equity: A
        Closed-Form Solution</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624613</link><description>The
        paper develops a novel econometric approach to estimate abnormal returns and
        systematic risk of private equity investments from observable investment cash
        flows. A unique feature of the method is that it gives closed-form estimators
        for systematic risk and abnormal returns. In addition, unlike previous studies
        that derive estimates based on the standard CAPM, the method employs a generalized
        CAPM that is based on the equilibrium model of Rubinstein (1976).This generalized
        CAPM accurately takes into account that private equity returns typically deviate
        from a normal distribution. The methodology is validated using numerical examples
        and is applied to a unique and comprehensive sample of 12,565 (7,732 venture
        capital and 4,833 buyout) fully realized portfolio company investments by
        private equity funds. The outperformance of venture capital investments documented
        is lower than found in previous studies that estimate a standard CAPM, which
        is consistent with the theory that investors require an additional premium
        for the negative coskewness reported for the sample investments. In contrast,
        we find a similar outperformance and systematic risk of buyout investments
        than previously documented, which is in line with the observation that the
        sample buyout investments do not exhibit significant coskewness. In addition,
        the results highlight that the log-utility CAPM, which provides estimates
        that are consistent with the standard PME, typically overstates the alpha
        from large beta assets, like venture capital investments, whereas it provides
        a good approximation for assets that have betas relatively close to one, like
        buyout investments.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:56:33 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Demystifying

        centuries, people worldwide have delighted themselves with the possession
        of products or services, which go beyond the realm of necessity and may be
        termed as luxury. The term &#8220;luxury&#8221; is often used in our daily
        lives to refer to products, services or a certain lifestyle, which go beyond
        bare essentials or comfort. The concept of luxury may differ from person to
        person depending on the exposure and experiences. This review paper is an
        attempt to clear the cloud over luxury brands as perceived now. The authors
        try to simplify and differentiate between the concept of &#8220;luxury&#8221;

        Dynamic Non-Direct Implementation Mechanism for Interdependent Value Problems,
        Second Version</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624627</link><description>Much
        of the literature on mechanism design and implementation uses the revelation
        principle to restrict attention to direct mechanisms. This is without loss
        of generality in a well defined sense. It is, however, restrictive if one
        is concerned with the set of equilibria, if one is concerned about the size
        of messages that will be sent, or if one is concerned about privacy. We showed
        in McLean and Postlewaite (2014) that when agents are informationally small,
        there exist small modifications to VCG mechanisms in interdependent value
        problems that restore incentive compatibility. We show here how one can construct
        a two-stage mechanism that similarly restores incentive compatibility while
        improving upon the direct one stage mechanism in terms of privacy and the
        size of messages that must be sent. The first stage essentially elicits that
        part of the agents'' private information that induces interdependence and
        reveals it to all agents, transforming the interdependent value problem into
        a private value problem. The second stage is a VCG mechanism for the now private
        value problem. Agents typically need to transmit substantially less information
        in the two stage mechanism than would be necessary for a single stage mechanism.
        Lastly, the first stage that elicits the part of the agents'' private information
        that induces interdependence can be used to transform certain other interdependent
        value problems into private value problems.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02

        in Limit Order Markets: Equilibrium Impact and Regulation</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624639</link><description>We
        investigate the impact of high-frequency trading (HFT) on market quality and
        investor welfare using a general limit order book model. We find that while
        the presence of HFT always improves market quality under symmetric information,
        under asymmetric information this is the case only if competition between
        high-frequency traders is sufficiently strong. While HFT does not negatively
        impact investor welfare, it reduces the welfare of slow speculators. The flexibility
        of the model allows investigating the effect of the main recent regulatory
        initiatives designed to curb HFT on market quality and investor welfare. We
        consider time-in-force rules, cancellation fees, transaction taxes, rebate
        fee structures, and speed bumps. While some of these regulations lead to improvements
        in a number of market quality measures, this generally does not translate
        into higher welfare for long-term investors. Rather, the main effect of such
        regulations is to generate wealth transfers from high-frequency traders to
        slow speculators. These regulations therefore appear inadequate to enhance
        investor welfare in the presence of HFTs. Of the different measures, transaction
        taxes are the least harmful; while they reduce welfare roughly by the amount
        of the tax, they do not significantly worsen market quality. The common practice
        by exchanges of granting rebates to limit orders is detrimental to market
        quality and investor welfare, causing both higher effective spreads and longer
        execution times.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:55:46 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Anomalies

        Meetings</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624653</link><description>This
        paper responds to the discussion initiated by the European Securities and
        Markets Authority (ESMA) about the role of proxy advisors at European annual
        general meetings (AGMs) by providing novel descriptive evidence on the influence
        and method consistency of these advisors for a major European market. We analyze
        a sample of 1,664 AGM agenda items for 185 unique firms and the corresponding
        proxy voting recommendations issued by Institutional Shareholder Services
        (ISS) for the German proxy season 2010. We find that a negative ISS voting
        recommendation is on average associated with an 8.5 percent decrease in shareholder
        support. This effect is even more pronounced for firms with high free float,
        low voting turnout, and high ISS client base. Additional analyses further
        reveal that ISS&#8217;s recommendations significantly correlate with ISS&#8217;s
        commercially available corporate governance ratings (GRId). This finding highlights
        a potential method consistency with respect to ISS&#8217;s employed governance
        standards. Overall, this paper extends the growing literature on proxy voting
        advisory and contributes to the current European debate on the regulation
        of proxy advisors.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:55:46 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Allowing

        and Cointegration</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624657</link><description>We
        propose a monitoring procedure to detect a structural change from stationary
        to integrated behavior. When the procedure is applied to the residuals of
        a relationship between integrated series it thus monitors a structural change
        from a cointegrating relationship to a spurious relationship. The cointegration
        monitoring procedure is based on residuals from modified least squares estimation,
        using either Fully Modified, Dynamic or Integrated Modified OLS. The procedure
        is inspired by Chu et al. (1996) in that it is based on parameter estimation
        on a pre-break "calibration" period only rather than being based on sequential
        estimation over the full sample. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of
        the procedures under the null, for (fixed and local) alternatives and in case
        of parameter changes. We also study the finite sample performance via simulations.
        An application to credit default swap spreads illustrates the potential usefulness
        of the procedure.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2015 12:53:04 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Children''s

        research investigates how a social innovation, here social and complementary
        currencies (SCC), is negotiated between different actors towards its official
        &#8220;recognition&#8221;. Our research follows through from the birth of
        the first local currencies in France on to the negotiations that affected
        the official recognition of local currencies through the 2014 &#8220;ESS Law
        &#8221;. We investigate the negotiations among diverse actors in a social

        fund flows chase alpha, yet they also follow returns attributable to traditional

        over time, with flows increasing their relative emphasis on returns from exotic
        betas in recent years. Investors also discriminate between which risks warrant
        high fees, with flows into high-fee funds being more likely to emphasize returns
        arising from exotic risks. Although we find strong evidence of persistence
        for alpha, persistence in hedge fund returns attributable to traditional and
        exotic risk exposures is modest, which suggests investors would benefit from

        &#8211; The   study   explores   the   difference   in   entrepreneurial   intentions,   perceived
        entrepreneurial   motivation, and   cognitive   profiles   (attitudes   towards   entrepreneurship,
        perceived   behaviour   control,   and   subjective   norms) between individuals   who
        have participated  in  enterprise  education  programmes in  the  universities
        and those  who  have  not. The   paper also investigates the   mediating   role   of   attitudes   towards   entrepreneurship,
        perceived  behaviour  control,  and  subjective  norms related  to entrepreneurial  motivation  and
        the forming of entrepreneurial intentions. Design/methodology/approach &#8211;
        Survey   information   from   321   students   from   three universities in
        the Ukraine was hand collected.  Hierarchical multiple regressions were used
        to test hypotheses.Findings &#8211; Individuals  who  participate  in  enterprise  programmes
        tend  to have  higher entrepreneurial motivation and are  more  likely  to  become
        entrepreneurs.  Empirical  evidence shows   that   attitudes,   subjective   norms   and   perceived   behaviour   control   mediate   the
        relations hip between perceived entrepreneurial motivation and entrepreneurial
        intentions.Research  limitations/implications &#8211; The  study  is  based  on  data  collected

        enterprise  in transitional  economies where attitudinal and resource (i.e.,
        skill, competence and knowledge)  deficiencies  can  retard  enterprise. Entrepreneurial  motivation  is
        an  important  link between an intention    and    action.    Enterprise    education    programs    which    stimulate
        entrepreneurial  motivation  should  be offered to engineering students since
        many of them  later start  ventures.  Engagement  into  enterprise  development  programs  of  engineering  students
        might evoke earlier interest in self-employment career path among young people.Originality/value

        Strategic Alliances: Case Study Insights from the Maritime Industry</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624814</link><description>Purpose
        - The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine the partner selection
        criteria reported by maritime firms in Norway. This study aims to analyze
        how a maritime firm&#8217;s competitive advantage can be enhanced by the selection
        of the right partner with reference to a strategic alliance.Design/methodology/approach
        - A multiple-case study methodology was used. Archival, survey and interview
        data were explored relating to the partner selection process reported by Norwegian
        maritime firms. Primary data was gathered from semi-structured personal interviews
        with managers of Norwegian maritime firms.Findings - Case study evidence suggests
        that the strategic alliances were successful when partners had been carefully
        selected. As detected elsewhere, successful alliances were associated with
        partners that had managed to build trustful and honest relationships, had
        common strategic goals, and partners that supplied resources and competencies.
        Notably, we detected that cyclicality in the maritime industry shaped the
        partner selection process. Trust between partners was used as mechanism to
        reduce uncertainty relating to the strategic alliance process. Firms seeking
        long-term alliances selected partners with substantial capital and financial
        stability to survive a market&#8217;s downturn, as well as the resources required
        for expansion during a recession.Practical implications - Presented findings
        have implications for practitioners, especially for managers of shipping firms,
        banks, shipyards, producers of ship equipment, ship design firms, and ship
        brokers. Practitioners need to be aware that the rationale for inter-firm
        collaboration change over time, and motives are linked to the phase of the
        maritime cycle. Inter-firm collaboration provides competitive advantage benefits
        to firms and collaboration can protect as well as create jobs and wealth creation
        in maritime communities.Originality/value - A novel conceptual contribution
        is the exploration of links between maritime industrial cyclicality and the
        partner selection process relating to strategic alliances. This study also
        adds to debates relating to the profiles of internationalizing smaller firms.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        Interfirm Collaboration in Ship Design</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624817</link><description>Purpose
        &#8211; The purpose of this study is to apply a mathematical method of formal
        concept analysis (FCA) to facilitate evaluation of potential partners, and
        to select the most appropriate partner for horizontal strategic alliances.
        Horizontal collaboration between ship design firms is important in relation
        to business cyclicality in the industry. The workload in ship design firms
        drops during the troughs of the shipbuilding cycle and increases dramatically
        during the peaks of the cycle.Design/methodology/approach &#8211; The proposed
        method of partnership selection applies FCA, which is based on mathematical
        lattice theory. FCA allows firms to evaluate and select the best suitable
        partners for horizontal interfirm cooperation from several possible candidate
        firms. Utilization of FCA allows a firm to visually analyze a potential partner
        for a horizontal strategic alliance.Findings &#8211; The contribution of this
        study to the literature is twofold. First, it contributes to the literature
        on the application of FCA in management field. Second, this study contributes
        to the partner selection literature. The contribution of the study is an alternative
        quantitative method for partner selection based on FCA. FCA compliments qualitative
        approaches in the process of alternatives evaluation and decision-making regarding
        partner selection for horizontal collaboration.Practical implications &#8211;
        Practitioners from ship design firms can use the FCA tool to facilitate decision-making
        relating to the screening of potential partners for horizontal cooperation
        with regard to pre-specified selected criteria.Originality/value &#8211; FCA
        has been marginally applied to aid managerial decision making. The FCA tool
        is valuable for practitioners from ship design firms to manage the selection
        of partners for horizontal collaboration. The FCA tool is associated with
        numerous advantages, notably, relative simplicity and versatility of visual
        analysis when compared with other mathematical approaches such as the AHP,
        the ANP, optimization modeling, and fuzzy set logic.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        use a simple model to illustrate that nominal GDP targeting might produce
        a suboptimal equilibrium if there is a growth-maximizing rate of inflation.
        Following a shock, we find that targeting nominal GDP may result in lower
        real GDP growth than the economy could sustainably produce given its long-run
        potential. Importantly, our argument does not depend on problems with forecasting
        or implementation. We assume the monetary authority has no trouble hitting
        its nominal GDP target. So long as a growth-maximizing rate of inflation exists,
        the suboptimal outcome results under the best-case scenario where the rule
        is followed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 12:54:46 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Transnational
        Constitutionalism and a Limited Doctrine of Unconstitutional Constitutional
        Amendment</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624838</link><description>This
        article, part of the ICON Symposium on The Challenge of Formal Amendment,
        was presented at the Inaugural Association of American Law Schools (AALS)
        Academic Symposium on January 5, 2014. A deep tension exists in many parts
        of the world between commitments to democracy and procedures for constitutional
        amendment. Amendments are frequently passed that follow formal democratic
        procedures but are aimed at achieving anti-democratic or &#8220;abusive&#8221;
        constitutional aims &#8212; i.e. to help powerful presidents extend their
        term in office, to remove parliamentary or federalism-based checks on executive
        power, and to narrow or suspend basic human rights protections. Limiting a
        power of constitutional amendment, therefore, can have clear democratic benefits.
        One way to do this is via a judicially enforceable doctrine of &#8220;unconstitutional
        constitutional amendment.&#8221; While such a doctrine may not be a complete
        solution to anti-democratic uses of constitutional amendment powers, it can
        create an additional hurdle to change. But such a doctrine should be approached
        with caution from a democratic perspective, because it can also create a significant
        road-block to the legitimate use of amendment procedures as a means of overriding
        courts decisions deemed unreasonable or unacceptable by a majority of citizens.
        In order to promote democracy rather than undermine it, any doctrine of unconstitutional
        constitutional amendment must be limited in scope. This article argues that
        because threats to a democratic order are so varied, and can be altered or
        staged by would-be authoritarian actors, limiting the doctrine to a narrow
        set of institutional provisions or principles defined ex ante is unlikely
        to be a stable solution. Instead, courts must rely on a broader doctrine that
        is nonetheless limited to constitutional amendments that clearly pose a substantial
        threat to core democratic values. This article also argues that an effective
        way to limit the use of such a doctrine is by tying its use to transnational
        constitutional norms. Engagement with transnational constitutional law will
        help to limit both the kinds of principles courts define as fundamental and
        the sorts of institutional changes that are alleged to pose a substantial
        threat to those principles. The article shows how engagement with transnational
        materials can serve as a workable check on a doctrine of unconstitutional
        constitutional amendment, helping to separate cases where the doctrine must
        be deployed to defend democracy from cases where its use is unnecessary.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        Change</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624842</link><description>This
        paper, presented at a symposium on Constitution-Making and Constitutional
        Design held at the Clough Center for the study of Constitutional Democracy
        at Boston College Law School on October 31, 2014, tackles a significant gap
        in constitutional theory -- the legal regulation of constitutional replacement.
        Recent work has recognized the risks posed by constitutional amendment to
        democracy and has developed a series of tools to mitigate those risks. In
        particular, would be authoritarian actors can engage in abusive forms of constitutional
        change that perpetuate their power and marginalize minority groups. In response,
        courts around the world have recognized that amendment can be limited in ways
        that go beyond the standard textual regulation of procedure to encompass both
        substantive ex ante controls (eternity clauses) and substantive ex post controls
        (the unconstitutional constitutional amendment doctrine). Constitutional replacement
        is usually seen as fundamentally different from constitutional amendment,
        but the two are often used jointly in projects of abusive constitutional change.
        Scholars and courts should thus consider ways in which constitutional replacement
        might be limited. The same list of possibilities utilized to constrain constitutional
        amendment -- substantive as well as procedural limits, and ex post as well
        as ex ante controls -- exists to constrain constitutional replacement. Moreover,
        each of these possibilities has actually been used, with varying degrees of
        success, in constitution-making processes in contexts like Venezuela, Bolivia,
        and South Africa. The key question is under which political conditions these
        tools might be effective. Based on the case studies, we suggest that those
        conditions are demanding but not impossible to meet in real-world constitution-making.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        paper investigated the precise mechanism adopted by some firms to enter and
        sustain in challenging, non-remunerative and fragmented markets like the Bottom
        of the Pyramid. Contrary to the received wisdom of a predominantly philanthropic
        orientation coupled with moderate profits, this paper argued that such ventures
        were motivated to revisit the cost structures of the venturing firms in an
        effort to become cost competitive in the conventional markets. To substantiate
        the above argument, a content analysis was performed on the published cases
        of firms operating at the Bottom of the Pyramid. The analysis revealed the
        adopted mechanisms and the possibly accrued economic benefits as a consequence
        of the choice of the mechanism, the same being reported in this paper.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        a Riemann sum limit type quantum integral I is defined on a subspace of a
        filtrated *-algebra B acting on a separable Hilbert space H , we show that
        one can construct a quantum finance model, representing a financial market
        of finitely many basic assets whose numeraire normalized values are {(Xi (t))t0}di=1
        as a filtrated von Neumann algebra A of bounded operators on H . A fundamental
        asset pricing theorem states that the market is arbitrage free if and only
        if there exists a faithful normal state rho in the predual A of A such that
        each (Xi (t)t0 is a rho-martingale. This allows one to assign fair prices
        to European contingent claims written on these basic assets in the market.A
        quantum finance model of this kind is established where I is the quantum stochastic
        integrals defined by the canonical unbounded quantum noises acting on a Boson
        Fock space. Two additional quantum finance models are sketched in this note.
        In the first model, the integration I is defined through the standard bounded
        quantum noises acting on a free Fock space. The quantum Brownian motions on
        two Fock spaces are tensor independent and free independent, free in the sense,
        respectively. The second model in this note is an abstraction of the above
        two when the quantum noises are Brownian motions. Utilizing the quantum integral
        theory on non-commutative Lp-space, we focus on a multi-factor free Brownian
        motion quantum finance model.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2015 12:53:04

        Bull and Bear Markets: Two Centuries of Evidence</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625037</link><description>Despite
        widespread media interest in bull and bear markets, academic research that
        seeks to formally define bull markets is almost non-existent. This paper defines
        bull and bear markets in relation to a simple model of mean return regimes,
        and implements the definition using two formal turning point detection methods
        to demonstrate that two centuries of stock index returns can be separated
        into economically and statistically significant bull and bear market states.
        In-sample analysis of the turning points identified by the detection procedures
        is consistent with a two-state mean return model, a result that has important
        implications for capital asset pricing theory.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        paper studies the effectiveness of a firm''s strategy to report on its environmental,
        social and corporate governance (ESG) activities with regard to the extent
        and direction in which the firm''s ESG performance gets valued by capital
        market investors. It is the first to disentangle different types of ESG reports
        and to analyze whether voluntarily following the current global trend of integrated
        report (IR) is worth the effort. Based on the empirical analysis of a large
        and diversified international set of exchange-listed firms, we find that ESG
        performance gets valued more strongly and in the (desired) positive direction
        in case a firm publishes an ESG report, irrespective of its type. Furthermore,
        results indicate that publishing an integrated report is not resulting in
        superior outcomes compared to a separate report. Similarly, signaling sustainability
        leadership by engaging in developing and moving towards an IR setup does not
        influence the value-relevance of ESG performance either. Our results are important
        for corporate managers as they help to understand investors'' perception of
        ESG performance and provide guidance for formulating and evaluating the reporting
        strategy, accordingly.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:56:33 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Does

        having daughters. First, acquisitions, debt and equity offerings made by CEOs
        with more daughters are better received by the market. Second, CEOs with more
        daughters are less likely to overpay the targets and better use newly raised
        capital. Third, CEOs'' daughter(s) decrease(s) corporate litigation risk.
        In sum, the gender of a child is arguably a random and natural experiment,

        The Case of Emerging Markets</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625058</link><description>This
        paper examines the relationships between market risk premiums, time-varying
        variance and covariance in forty-eight emerging, and seven developed capital
        markets. We allow each market&#8217;s risk premium generating process to be
        state-dependent by accounting for negative and positive market price of variance
        and covariance risk. We find that half of the emerging markets exhibit reward
        to world variance while for the other half are only sensitive to local risk
        factors. We also find evidence of a negative relationship between reward to
        local risk and reward to world risk. Accordingly, the relative importance
        of one reward versus the other depends on the ever-changing correlation with
        the world market. Finally, we show that correlation is not a factor that explains
        reward to local risk in few segmented capital markets.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        paper provides the first investigation of the hedging effectiveness of the
        FTSE 100 and FTSE Mid 250 stock index futures contracts using hedge ratios
        generated within an extended mean Gini framework. This framework provides
        a robust alternative to the standard minimum variance approach, by distinguishing
        between different classes of risk aversion and producing hedge ratios that
        are consistent with the rules of stochastic dominance. The results show that
        the appropriate hedge ratio varies considerably with the investor&#8217;s
        degree of risk aversion and that the EMG approach is capable of being utilized
        by all classes of risk averse investors, in contrast to the standard minimum
        variance approach. In addition, the results show strong evidence of a duration

        prices are more volatile than exchange rates and interest rates. Hence, a

        commodity price exposure of a large sample of nonfinancial firms. The results
        indicate that corporations exhibit net exposures with regard to several commodity

        risk is, however, not found to be of greater importance than other financial

        paper examines the impact of the introduction of the futures market, on the
        volatility of the underlying Portuguese stock market. The simple analysis
        of variance is only the first step to a later undertaking of a much more robust
        methodology which involves the application of a GARCH model, with the main
        purpose of studying some potential changes on the structure of the conditional
        volatility of the Portuguese stock market. The results for the Portuguese
        market are not identical to those generally found internationally. The initial
        and simple analysis of variance seems to suggest a strong increase in the
        level of volatility. When a GARCH model is applied, with the main purpose
        of studying the evolution of the structure of the conditional volatility,
        a reduction in market efficiency, measured by its ability to quickly incorporate
        new information, is identified.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:56:33

        effects for 359 TSX listed IPO&#8217;s in the period 1984-2002 are examined.
        Based on first day returns, earning positive mean returns is very difficult
        even when most IPO&#8217;s are purchased at the offer price. Mean daily trade
        volume for the first five days of IPO trading is large relative to the means
        for the first thirty days and for longer periods. The dollar volume of sells
        is always significantly larger than that of buys suggesting that institutional
        investors are active on the sell side in the aftermarket. Liquidity as measured
        by quoted depth is initially large and decays rapidly over time. Gross returns
        are often low or negative, and average round-trip trade costs increase from
        1.5% to 2.9% and 1.8% to 3.7% for more and less patient traders, respectively,
        over the first nine months of trading for an average IPO. Early amortized
        spreads are relatively large due to large initial share turnover.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        of the main reasons that investment advisors recommend international investments
        is that foreign stocks are not highly correlated with U.S. stocks. As world

        international stock market correlation, and assesses whether global diversification
        on a sector basis is beneficial to U.S. investors. This analysis includes
        38 developed and emerging stock markets from 1981-2000. In addition to demonstrating
        a potential loss of diversification benefits, this paper utilizes an optimal

        the environmental factors) that influence efficiency of banks in the region
        have been explained and the mean efficiency of large banks in different countries

        paper uses a two-step methodology to examine the relationship between managerial
        cost inefficiency and the takeover of U.S. thrifts during a period of market
        liberalization and widespread takeover activity, 1994 to 2000. In the first
        stage using stochastic cost frontiers, controllable managerial cost inefficiency
        scores are estimated for all stock firms operating each year in 1994 to 2000.
        In a second stage, these scores are used to examine correlates of takeovers,
        focusing on cost inefficiency. For takeovers by banks, a significant negative
        relationship between cost inefficiency and takeover is found, suggesting an
        exit of more cost efficient firms from the thrift industry during this period.
        However, takeovers by thrifts are associated with other characteristics.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        in the U.S.</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625087</link><description>In
        their competitive analysis of proposed bank mergers, the Board of Governors
        of the Federal Reserve System, the U.S. Department of Justice, and other U.S.
        banking agencies accept branch divestitures as an antitrust remedy in local
        markets where there is substantial overlap between the acquirer and target.
        The results of this study, which examines the performance of 751 branches
        that were divested between June 1989 and June 1999 in conjunction with a merger
        in the U.S. that raised possible competition issues, are consistent with the
        policy of accepting branch divestitures as an antitrust remedy being successful.
        Divested branches operate for lengths of time that are comparable to all branches,
        and even though they experience substantial deposit runoff around the time
        of the merger, divested branches subsequently exhibit deposit growth rates

        This article discusses how the home country of rating agencies could affect
        rating decisions as a result of political economy influences and cultural
        distance. Using data from nine agencies based in six countries, we test whether
        agencies assign better ratings to their home countries, as well as to countries
        economically, geopolitically and culturally aligned with them. Our results
        show biases in favor of the respective home country, culturally more similar
        countries, and countries in which home-country banks have a larger risk exposure.
        Linguistic similarity seems to be the main transmission channel that explains

        faced low direct costs but high frictions, and that the largest premium coincided
        with a high price charged by market makers to carry new positions. On the
        demand side, we find that those investors in more distress or with more active

        observed changes in share prices at the ex-dividend day have led researchers
        to look for a single marginal investor, either a long or a short term trader
        with different tax status, dominating all trades to explain the ex-day pricing
        in different markets. This paper provides a model which extends this research
        in three directions. One, it allows for the possibility that different types
        of traders may influence different stocks, thereby generating a separating
        equilibrium. Two, it identifies an additional marginal investor who has the
        option of being taxed as a short term or long term trader. Three, it explicitly
        models the fact that it can take a considerable time from when a dividend
        based trade is made until taxes have to be paid on that trade. A unique data
        set from New Zealand is used for the empirical analysis. Evidence of a separating

        of Monetary Policy on Commercial Banks Across Different Business Conditions</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625113</link><description>The
        objective of the paper is to investigate whether the stock price reactions
        of commercial banks to monetary policy actions are dependent on the state
        of the economy. The results indicate that monetary policy actions have asymmetric
        effects on the returns of commercial banks across different monetary policy
        and business environments. The asymmetric effects can primarily be attributed
        to the asymmetric effects of monetary policy on discount rates across different
        monetary and business environments. We also observe that the impact of monetary
        policy on the returns of commercial banks is affected by bank-specific characteristics.
        Bank size, leverage and profitability play an important role in explaining
        the cross-sectional variation in bank returns as a result of monetary policy
        changes. We find that cross-sectional bank-specific characteristics affect
        the bank returns asymmetrically as a result of monetary policy changes across
        different business conditions. The results suggest that the effectiveness

        soundness and argues that if the first is not achieved the second is not likely
        either with serious adverse consequences. Instability in banking is most often
        the result of actions by governments directed at the macroeconomy and banks
        to achieve short-run goals with little consideration for unintended immediate
        or longer-term consequences. Without government interference, there is little
        evidence that the banking system is unstable. This paper develops a framework
        for designing optimum regulatory structures that, if adopted by countries,
        will help to reduce instability in their banking systems and thereby also
        in their macroeconomies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:55:10 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Just
        and Reasonable: The Cornerstone of Energy Regulation</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625131</link><description>"Just
        and Reasonable" is the standard language in both the Federal Power Act and
        most state regulatory acts, yet it is rarely defined. Parsing the terms provides
        little illumination as to their meaning.  The meaning of just and reasonable
        has evolved from its origin in Roman and Medieval law, through English common
        law, and interpretation of its use as aspirational language in legislative.  More
        recently, just and reasonable has been redefined and constrained by the Mobile-Sierra
        doctrine in the context of competitive energy markets. Just and reasonable
        should not be seen as an alternative to the public interest, rather, it is
        one component of the public interest(s) that are the goal of economic regulation.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        on the Trading Volume and Volatility in the Domestic Market</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625134</link><description>This
        paper investigates the impact of ADR listing on the trading volume and volatility
        of the domestic market. Existing theories indicate that trading shifts to
        a market with lower transaction costs, and the level of volatility is directly
        related to the level of trading activity. The analyses provide empirical evidence
        showing increase in both trading volume and price volatility in the domestic
        market after ADR listing. The increase in volatility is attributed to noise
        resulting from public information as opposed to from increased trading friction.
        This suggests improvement in liquidity following ADR listing. Comparison across
        country groups indicates marginally higher gain for emerging market stocks
        although the difference is not statistically significant. Auction type markets
        gain more in terms of increase in trading volume than dealer type markets.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        Associated with Changes in the Danish Blue-Chip Index: The KFX Index</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625140</link><description>This
        paper considers the effects of changes in the composition of the Danish blue-chip
        KFX index for the period of 1989-2001. Consistent with the selection criterion
        used for the index, there is no evidence for a stock price effect at the announcement
        of a change in the index. However, deleted stocks experience an abnormal return
        averaging -13% in a six-month period before the deletion and a decrease in
        trading volume and efficiency of stock prices following the deletion. For
        added stocks, the average abnormal return is 8% and there is no significant
        change in trading volume or efficiency. These long-run effects are best explained
        by the imperfect substitutes hypothesis or the information costs/liquidity
        hypothesis, suggesting that stocks in the KFX Index are exposed to a higher
        demand or more attention and a lower cost of trading than stocks outside the
        index.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:56:33 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Performance
        Consequences of Privatizing Egyptian State-Owned Enterprises: The Effect of
        Post-Privatization Ownership Structure on Firm Performance</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625143</link><description>This
        paper evaluates the financial and operating performance of newly privatized
        Egyptian state-owned enterprises and determines whether such performance differs
        across firms according to their new ownership structure. The Egyptian privatization
        program provides unique post-privatization data on different ownership structures.
        Since most studies do not distinguish between the types of ownership, this
        paper provides new insight into the impact that post-privatization ownership
        structure has on firm performance. The study covers 69 firms, which were privatized
        between 1994 and 1998. For these newly privatized firms, this study documents
        significant increases in profitability, operating efficiency, capital expenditures,
        and dividends. Conversely, significant decreases in employment, leverage,
        and risk are found, although output shows an insignificant decrease following
        privatization.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:56:33 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Shareholders
        Wealth Effects of Joint Venture Strategies</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625149</link><description>We
        investigate the shareholder wealth effects of 233 joint venture announcements
        of Dutch public companies in the period 1987 till 1998. The research shows
        that, on average, establishing joint ventures has a positive effect on the
        market value of Dutch companies. Using the strategic characteristics of joint
        ventures it is possible to explain and understand these wealth effects. Our
        research shows that the factors of strategic intention, the context in which
        the strategy is unfolded and the extent to which the company has control over
        the implementation strongly explains the extent to which a joint venture can

        Information Arrival and Emerging Markets Returns and Volatility</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625150</link><description>Recent
        findings have heightened the debate about the usefulness of public information
        in asset markets. Using daily composite and sector index returns, this paper
        examines the role of public information arrival in an emerging, high-inflation
        economy like Turkey. The findings reveal that real GDP and industrial production
        announcements have the most important impact on stock returns. Regarding inflation,
        nominal stock returns increase in response to unfavorable inflation announcements,
        but only for the financials sector and partially. Market volatility is more
        sensitive to news about real GNP, balance of trade, tourism and construction.

        Models and Portfolio Strategies: A Multinomial Approach</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625155</link><description>This
        paper uses a multinomial framework to develop several takeover prediction
        models. The motivation for this approach lies with Morck, Shleifer and Vishny
        (1988), who note that separate considerations are appropriate for predicting
        which firms are subject to hostile (disciplinary) and friendly (synergistic)
        takeovers in the USA. In a typical binomial setting, in which takeover targets
        are treated as belonging to one homogenous group, differences between hostile
        and friendly targets are ignored. This may result in biased takeover probabilities
        and poor predictive performance. Using UK data, the results from this paper
        show that the characteristics of hostile and friendlytargets do differ, particularly
        in terms of firm size. The multinomial models also have higher significance
        and explanatory power when compared to the binomial models. Furthermore, when
        the models are tested in an investment portfolio setting, the results suggest
        that a strategy of predicting hostile targets only, beats a benchmark control
        portfolio of firms of a similar size and market-to-book.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        the Source of FDI Important to Emerging Market Economies? Evidence from Japanese
        and U.S. FDI</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625173</link><description>This
        paper takes the position that technology transfers associated with foreign
        direct investment inflows (FDI) are an important determinant of economic growth
        in developing countries. The paper also posits that technology transfers,
        ceteris paribus, depend on the attributes of FDI providers, particularly as
        they relate to the degree of technological advancement and the behavioral
        aspects of the technology transfer. Japan and the U.S. are two important sources
        of FDI where multinational corporations domiciled in the two nations exhibit
        distinct variation in these attributes. Consistent with earlier research,
        the findings of this paper lend support for a positive role of FDI inflows
        from the advanced countries in increasing the economic growth of developing
        countries. The paper further finds some evidence that the relationship between
        the economic growth of the host countries and FDI inflows is stronger for
        U.S. originated FDI than that of Japanese originated FDI.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        Environments Around Interim Earnings Announcements on the Helsinki Stock Exchange</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625174</link><description>This
        paper tests the hypothesis that an anticipated information event affects the
        use of trading venues. Data from the Helsinki Stock Exchange are used where
        an upstairs market co-exists with a downstairs market. Trades are classified
        also as in-house trades and externalized trades. This paper suggests that
        interim earnings announcement affects where trades are executed. The results
        indicate that an anticipated announcement increases downstairs trading before
        the announcement event. Correspondingly trades in the upstairs market tend
        to decrease before the announcement. After the announcement upstairs trading
        recovers. Furthermore, the empirical findings suggest that the in-house trades
        in the upstairs market are positively related to the liquidity and volatility
        during the pre-announcement period. After the announcement the volatility
        association changes resulting in increased downstairs trading with high volatility.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        events? This paper employs a dynamic version of the APT model for the period
        from 1991 to 1998 to determine whether the increase in volatility on the JSE
        changed the specification of the APT model as it applied to the Financial
        &amp; Industrial Index of the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (JSE). The
        finding is that political events in late 1991, and economic events in mid
        1994, changed APTM&#8217;s specification. This would indicate that during
        periods of profound political change, political events drive stock market

        Productivity and Economic Development: Caloric Suitability vs. Agricultural
        Suitability</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625180</link><description>This
        paper establishes that the Caloric Suitability Index (CSI) dominates the commonly
        used measure of agricultural suitability in the examination of the effect
        of land productivity on comparative economic development. The analysis demonstrates
        that the agricultural suitability index does not capture the large variation
        in the potential caloric yield across equally suitable land, reflecting the
        fact that land suitable for agriculture is not necessarily suitable for the
        most caloric-intensive crops. Hence, in light of the instrumental role played
        by caloric yield in sustaining and supporting population growth, and given
        importance of pre-industrial population density for the subsequent course
        of economic development, the Caloric Suitability Index dominates the conventional
        measure in capturing the effect of land productivity on pre-colonial population
        density and the subsequent course of economic development.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        aim of this paper is to identify whether the GARCH or the SV based models
        provide the best goodness of fit to financial time-series data. To investigate
        the issue, three different formulations for each type (i.e., the standard
        model, the fat-tailed model, and the asymmetric model) are examined. The models
        are first compared on theoretical grounds, then estimated using the daily
        returns from four market indices, and finally subjected to some diagnostic
        tests. The results demonstrate that for the standard formulation, the SV model
        fits data better than the GARCH model, while the fat-tailed and the asymmetric
        models roughly equivalent in describing the key features of returns. The results
        provide a preliminary analysis for selecting the best model with which to
        forecast the volatility of financial returns.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03

        factions are rarely treated as normatively desirable entities in constitutional
        or international law.  On the contrary, they are either are regarded as forces
        that thwart the general welfare or as sources of chronic political instability.  In
        response, the conventional wisdom often focuses on how to deploy institutional
        or legal structures that minimize the influence of faction. By contrast, this
        Essay argues that the institutions of constitutional and international law
        that are forged by self-interested factions can create significant side benefits
        for the rest of the society.  At bottom, such institutions are likely to be
        more durable and energetic than those created by disinterested or high-minded
        social designers. Thus, rather than focus on trying to curtail the influence
        of faction in shaping political institutions, it may make more sense to broaden
        the scope of such influence to be as inclusive as possible.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        the Rabbit Hole of ''Deactivating Active Share'' (and Back Out Again?)</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625214</link><description>The
        April 2015 paper &#8220;Deactivating Active Share&#8221;, released by AQR
        Capital Management, aims to debunk the claim that Active Share (a measure
        of active management) predicts investment performance. The claim of the AQR
        paper is that &#8220;neither theory nor data justify the expectation that
        Active Share might help investors improve their returns,&#8221; arguing that
        previous results are &#8220;entirely driven by the strong correlation between
        Active Share and the benchmark type.&#8221; This paper&#8217;s first and main
        aim is to establish that the AQR paper should not be interpreted using typical
        academic standards. Instead, our conjecture is that this AQR paper falls into
        a wonderfully creative but altogether different genre, which we label the
        Wonderland Genre, as its main characteristic seems to be &#8220;Sentence First,
        Verdict Later.&#8221; For example, the results in the AQR-WP cannot be taken
        at face value, as the information that is not shared reverses their main conclusion.Secondarily,
        we consider the plausible claim that benchmark styles matter and find that
        controlling for the main benchmark style, the predictability of Active Share
        is robust. While Active Share is only one tool among many to analyze investment
        funds and needs to be carefully interpreted for each fund individually, Active
        Share may indeed plausibly help investors improve their returns. Thirdly and
        finally, we impolitely consider why AQR may not be a big fan of Active Share
        by taking a look at the AQR mutual funds offered to retail investors. We find
        that these tend to have relatively low Active Shares, have shown little outperformance
        to date (with performance data ending in 2014) and thus seem fairly expensive
        given the amount of differentiation they offer.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        Free Trade Constitution</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625229</link><description>In
        the United States, commentators often contend that our constitutional structure
        of government can be reformed to promote the general welfare at the expense
        of special interest groups.  Supposedly, one such constitutional innovation
        &#8212; touted widely in the literature &#8212; is the long standing practice
        in which Congress delegates significant international trade authority to the
        President.  In the now familiar tale of institutional beneficence, starting
        in 1934 Congress agreed to sacrifice some portion of its constitutional authority
        for the greater good.  By doing so, Congress was able to disempower narrow
        interest groups and enable the President to pursue trade policies that benefit
        the general welfare.  There is one problem with this account: it is not quite
        true.  Neither reciprocity nor the delegation of trade authority to the President
        were efforts to transcend interest group pressure; on the contrary, they were
        very much the products of interest group politics.  Moreover, they were not
        particularly novel.  Both delegation and reciprocity had been deployed by
        politicians to secure protectionist policy goals in the latter part of the
        nineteenth and early twentieth century.  In the end, there are likely no set
        of constitutional structures that will continually guarantee a path to free
        trade; instead, the relationship between free trade and constitutional institutions
        is largely contingent and dependent on interest group politics.</description><pubDate>Fri,

        in Brazil</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2611952</link><description>In
        the mid-1990s, Brazil introduced electronic voting technology that  reduced
        residual ballots and consequently expanded de facto enfranchisement. We employ
        a regression discontinuity design similar to that of preceding studies on
        the issue to show that electronic technology also caused a sharp rise in party
        label votes (votos de legenda) that can only be explained by errors  induced
        by forcing votes to be cast in a specific and unintuitive order. We show that
        error offsets a large portion of the gains in enfranchisement, highlighting
        the fact that even generally positive changes in voting procedures can have
        negative effects. Our results also imply that  party label votes should not
        be considered a measure of party strength in the Brazilian context.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        forecasts are quite essential in our daily lives, which is why many research

        optimal method of combination. We linearly combine multiple linear combinations
        of existing forecasts to form a new forecast (&#8220;combination of combinations&#8221;),
        and the weights are given by Bayesian model averaging. In the case of forecasts

        Disclosure and Firm-Level Investment Efficiency: Evidence from China''s Listed

        paper examines the impact of Corporation Social Responsibility (CSR) disclosure
        on firm-level investment efficiency. In 2009, in Shanghai Stock Exchange and
        Shenzhen Stock Exchange, China Securities Regulatory Commission mandated listed
        firms on the specified boards to disclose their CSR, and encouraged others
        to report CSR in voluntary. Based on a set of unique data from Chinese listed
        firms during 2010 to 2013, we find that higher investment efficiency exists
        in the CSR reporting firms, especially in overinvestment ones. Moreover, this
        association is more pronounced in the firms with lower financial reporting
        quality. We argue that this results support that the CSR disclosures can provide
        effective incremental information to help reducing the information asymmetry.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        of Bamayan Buddhist statues, prohibiting yoga, allowing child marriage and
        banning Pok&#233;mon in Saudi Arabia. Such reporting sets up a paradigm of
        &#8216;unfathomable Muslims&#8217; versus us, the rational westerners. Contrary
        to public perception, a fatwa has nothing to do with a proclamation of death.
        This misconception arose because the best known fatwa in the West, issued
        20 years ago by Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran, condemned as blasphemy and apostasy
        the writing and publication of the Satanic Verses. It culminated in a call
        for &#8216;all zealous Muslims to execute them [author Salman Rushdie and
        the publishers] quickly&#8217;. This fatwa was controversial for many reasons,
        and its validity was rejected by other Muslim scholars.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        of Europe''s Classical Law of Nations</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2623086</link><description>The
        jurisprudence of the law of nature and nations of the Early-Modern Age holds
        pride of place in the modern historiography of international law. Whereas
        the classical writers of that age undeniably exercised a significant influence
        on 19th-century international law, their utility as a historical source for
        the study of the law of nations from their own period has been far overrated.
        The development of the law of nations between 1500 and 1800 was much more
        informed by State practice than historians have commonly credited.Moreover,
        historiography overestimates the novelty of the contribution of early-modern
        jurisprudence and has almost negated its major historic source of inspiration:
        the late-medieval jurisprudence of canon and Roman law. It is important to
        restore medieval jurisprudence to its rightful place in the grand narrative
        of the evolution of international law in Europe. Doing this renders a deeper
        insight into the dynamics of the jurisprudence of the Early-Modern Age. It
        shows that natural law acted as a vessel to recycle many of the doctrines
        of medieval jurisprudence into the language of the early-modern law of nations.
        But it also shows how it was an altogether feeble attempt at replacing the
        restrictive authority of scholastic jurisprudence with that of natural justice.
        As long as the fear of God gave teeth to the precepts of natural justice,
        it retained some real impact. But one this was lost and 19th-century international
        lawyers cut the historic bonds between natural law and religion, they pushed
        it to the wayside and ostracised it altogether from their world.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        Burnside&#8217;s book, "God, Justice, and Society", presents a confronting
        thesis. For not only is his argument grounded in religious belief rather than
        secular philosophy, but it is concerned with biblical law, expressed in and
        through the many and varied genres of the Hebrew and Christian scriptures.
        Burnside&#8217;s thesis is thus doubly provocative in our secular times. It
        unashamedly appeals to the revealed texts of the Jewish and Christian religions,
        and it unapologetically grapples with what might be thought of as their most
        imposing aspects &#8212; the parts that present themselves as "law." As such,
        Burnside&#8217;s book is concerned with those parts of the Bible that seem
        to be the most emphatically authoritative in tone and intent.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        and misconduct in the financial market became in the recent years a key issue
        of regulation in the context of financial crisis. The paper investigates the
        French financial supervisor (Autorit&#233; des march&#233;s financiers) sanctions
        policy and practices. It argues that the Autorit&#233; des march&#233;s financiers
        has made a shift over time from a substantive to a procedural regulation of
        finance. This change consists in departing from a sanction of observed outcomes
        in the market and, instead, to assess the performance of internal-organizational
        schemes of financial firms. Therefore the new AMF policy and practice involve
        a process of legalization of organizations; it also gives evidence of a process
        of delegation of regulation at the level of financial firms themselves.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        Pars/North Field has been the largest shared oil and gas reservoir and offshore
        field ever discovered. This super giant reservoir is shared between Iran and
        Qatar and unreasonable overdrilling and dissipation close to the border of
        both countries have rapidly removed enormous amount of gas out of the reservoir.
        Undoubtedly, this non-scheduled exploitation has caused migration of fluids
        to the other side, and reduced the reservoir pressure. In case of sudden ruin
        of reservoir or any prevailing loss in any side of the border, the parties
        is likely to come across a complicated legal conflict in their relationship.In
        the same situation the States in different regions have done precautionary
        measures to resolve the problem. They have entered in to agreements in various
        structures affected by political, regional and historical conditions of the
        parties. In the present condition, the joint development agreement along with
        the joint authority is recognised to be the best solution. If Iran and Qatar
        come to an agreement for joint development of South Pars/North Field in their
        marine delimited border, the parties will benefit surveillance management
        of the reserve, and this would lead to an outstanding model for other shared
        oil and gas resources and another States practice that reinforces the formation
        of customary international law in this case.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01

        enforcement of the legal framework on market abuse in the EU requires that
        sanctions available to the competent authorities are effective, proportionate
        and dissuasive. However, sanctioning regimes based on administrative sanctions
        are regarded as generally weak. The European Commission considers that introduction

        with the introduction of criminal sanctions for market abuse in the EU. It
        is divided into four sections. The first section introduces the current legislative
        framework to tackle market abuse at the level of the EU. Subsequently, the
        second section points out the weak enforcement of sanctions for market abuse.
        The third section answers the question as to why the EU does act through criminal
        law. A final fourth section deals with the introduction of criminal sanctions
        for market abuse in light of a Proposal for a Directive on criminal sanctions

        paper studies the current state and drivers of government local currency bond
        market (LCBM) development in Sub-Saharan Africa. We argue that well-developed
        government LCBMs could reduce countries&#8217; exposure to external shocks;
        help overcome &#8216;original sin&#8217;; facilitate domestic savings mobilisation;
        and may have important financial, macroeconomic and institutional spill-overs.
        With detailed information collected from various sources the paper first shows
        that quite a few African countries have made significant progress in developing
        LCBMs. Increasingly, African governments issue fixed-rate local currency bonds
        with tenors of ten years and more on a regular basis. However, we also find
        that LCBMs in Africa often have low liquidity, feature very few corporate
        securities and generally have relatively narrow investor bases dominated by
        commercial banks. The second part of the study presents an econometric analysis
        of the drivers of African government LCBMs based on a new high-quality panel
        dataset compiled by the OECD. Our results indicate that LCBM capitalisation
        is correlated negatively with governments&#8217; fiscal balance and inflation,
        and positively with common law legal origins, institutional quality and strong
        democratic political systems.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:56:38

        retirement glidepaths evolve over time based on some measure such as the retiree&#8217;s
        funded status or current market valuations.  Conversely, static glidepaths
        are fixed at a starting point and selected under the assumption that they
        will not change.  In practice, new static glidepaths may be derived periodically
        making them more flexible.  The optimal static retirement glidepath would
        be the one that performs better than all others with respect to some metric.  When
        systematic withdrawals are made from a retirement portfolio, glidepaths are
        often assessed via the probability of ruin (or success).  Our goal here is
        to derive the optimal static glidepath with respect to this metric.  It is
        a result new to the literature and the shape will be of special interest to
        retirees, financial advisors, retirement researchers, and target-date fund

        important unresolved issue is the extent to which bank transparency promotes
        or undermines bank stability. Conflicting views on transparency create a demand
        for empirical research that can provide insights into the nature of transparency
        and when, where and how it positively or negatively affects bank stability.
        Financial accounting information is an integral component of transparency
        and as such is a powerful point of entry for empirical investigations of bank
        transparency. This paper discusses key insights from recent research that
        investigates relations between bank transparency as viewed through the lens
        of financial accounting and bank stability. The paper focuses on real consequences
        of accounting policy choices on individual bank downside tail risk, codependence
        of tail risk among banks, and regulatory forbearance. I emphasize the role
        played by managerial discretion over accounting decisions in influencing bank
        stability through two distinct accounting channels: bank transparency and
        the role of accounting numbers as numerical inputs into the calculations of
        regulatory ratios such as bank capital ratios. Suggestions for future research
        are provided.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:55:10 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Currency
        Board Arrangement Capital Structure Macrofinancial Diagnostics</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624333</link><description>We
        build a structural credit risk model for an emerging market country which
        follows a fixed exchange rate regime under a Currency Board Arrangement (CBA).
        It is assumed that the sovereign has bonds outstanding both in local soft
        currency (treasuries) and in hard currency (Eurobonds). In such a setting,
        the liability side of the balance sheet of the country can be viewed as composed
        of three items in increasing order of seniority -- monetary base, domestic
        debt, and foreign debt. The foreign debt is the most senior tranche in the
        capital structure and has a typical payment priority due to the presence of
        limited foreign exchange reserves. The monetary base is the most junior one
        and has the characteristics of equity. In pursuing optimal financial and macroeconomic
        policies, the sovereign affects the fundamental values of the three instruments.
        We quantify the effects that arise and this allows us to make a thorough macrofinancial
        diagnostics of the CBA. We discuss further issues related to optimal capital
        structure, debt issuance and buy-backs, sterilizations, and general financial
        challenges of conducting macro policy under credit risk and fixed exchange
        rate. We make an empirical application to a representative set of countries
        following a CBA.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:54:29 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Major

        since the Classics and Marx all major economic schools have defended the claim

        the task is still before us. The way forward is to move from behavioral to
        structural economics. In what we should be mostly interested are not so much
        the behavioral defects of economic agents but the structural defects of the

        Causes, Consequences, and Policy Responses</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624398</link><description>Following
        four years of relative stability at around $105 per barrel, oil prices have
        declined sharply since June 2014. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis
        of the sources of the recent decline in prices, and examines its macroeconomic,
        financial and policy implications. The recent drop in prices is a significant,
        but not an unprecedented event as it has some significant parallels with the
        price collapse in 1985-86. The recent decline has been driven by a number
        of factors: several years of upward surprises in the production of unconventional
        oil; weakening global demand; a significant shift in OPEC policy; unwinding
        of some geopolitical risks; and an appreciation of the U.S. dollar. Although
        the relative importance of each factor is difficult to pin down, OPEC&#8217;s
        renouncement of price support and rapid expansion of oil supply from unconventional
        sources appear to have played a crucial role since mid-2014. The oil price
        drop will lead to substantial income shifts from oil exporters to oil importers
        resulting in a net positive effect for global activity over the medium term.
        Although several factors could counteract its impact on global growth and
        inflation, the drop in oil prices will pose significant challenges for monetary,
        fiscal, and structural policies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:55:10

        begin by clarifying Machiavelli&#8217;s overly simplified platitude: a leader
        should be loved or feared.  I also show that Machiavelli&#8217;s short-term
        political paradigm is present in business and that raises ethical and economic
        conflicts.  I believe these conflicts could be obviated with the ethics of
        care.  I thereby introduce the ethics of care as defined by Virginia Held
        with focus on care as the larger framework in which regulations should fit.  I
        then develop the view of business [with care] that habituates actions to yield
        intended consequences, as care is entirely concerned with long-term goals.  I
        examine care through a closer understanding of individuals, relationships,
        and concepts of ownership.  I include a case study on the financial crisis
        to show how public systems would fall apart without care.  I conclude with
        a perspective on that, and how the crisis was unique to the housing bubble
        and not previous recessions following the Great Depression.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        in Reducing Flotation Costs: Evidence from Seasoned Equity Offerings</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624424</link><description>We
        examine the effect on expected flotation costs of including co-managers in
        the underwriting syndicate. We consider five components of SEO flotation costs:
        announcement returns, underpricing, the probability of withdrawals, offering
        delays, and underwriting spreads. The results show that the characteristics
        of co-managers participating in syndicates have significant effects on flotation
        costs, while the effect of the number of co-managers is largely insignificant.
        Our results are consistent with the notion that highly reputable underwriters
        and commercial banks serving as co-managers serve a certification role, reducing
        information asymmetries and, as a result, lowering SEO flotation costs.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        capital (VC) firms raising funds from their limited partners (LPs) have to
        provide arguments extending beyond the firm&#8217;s track record to convince
        those partners to commit to their fund. We suggest that the subdimensions
        of perceived trustworthiness, that is, perceived ability, integrity, and benevolence,
        play a vital role in the relationship between VCs and their potential LPs.
        Our analysis of a worldwide sample of 148 LPs sheds light on LP decision making.
        In particular, VC firms with medium to high levels of track records seem to
        benefit from managing trustworthiness. Hence, a VC firm&#8217;s trustworthiness
        is not a substitute for a track record but instead something that complements

        Rock Trumps Paper: A Theory of Constitutional Resistance</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624459</link><description>When
        emergency provisions in the constitution are abused, they pose a threat to
        the legal order. Citizen mobilization has been proposed as a mechanism to
        constrain the executive from such abuses of power. Specifically, if the executive
        oversteps its authority, the opposition can overthrow the government by mobilizing
        citizens against the power maximizing behavior. Despite the abundance of contributions
        on citizen''s activism, constitutionally protected resistance has been neglected.
        This paper covers the gap by proposing a definition of constitutional resistance,
        which distinguishes it from other forms of disobedience and protest. Moreover,
        the importance of properly delineating the right is discussed and it is argued
        that such a right is not simply a parchment barrier. Specifically, the paper
        theorizes that the inclusion of the right tips the scale in favor of resisting
        even minor transgressions, leading to a more constrained executive power.
        However, if the right is not properly delineated it creates adverse incentives,
        jeopardizing political stability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:54:42

        the simple and optimal monetary and macroprudential policy rules that include
        credit variables in addition to the consumption gap and inflation rate as

        the estimated Taylor rule for the Korean economy. Simultaneously, simple macro-prudential
        and monetary policy rules with credit terms do not always improve welfare.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        to Fed Funds Rate Surprises: State Dependence and the Financial Crisis</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624482</link><description>This
        paper examines the response of US stock returns to Federal Funds rate (FFR)
        surprises between 1989 and 2012, focusing on the impact of the recent financial
        crisis. We find that outside the crisis period, stock prices increased as
        a response to unexpected FFR cuts. State dependence is identified with stocks
        exhibiting larger increases when interest rate easing coincided with recessions,
        bear markets, and tightening credit conditions. However, an important structural
        shift occurred during the crisis, changing the stocks&#8217; response to FFR
        shocks and the nature of state dependence. Throughout the crisis period, stocks
        did not react positively to unexpected FFR cuts, which were interpreted as
        signals of worsening future economic conditions. This triggered a rebalancing
        of investment portfolios away from falling equities and towards safe-haven
        assets. Our results highlight the severity of the crisis and the ineffectiveness
        of conventional monetary policy close to the zero lower bound.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        in the equity of younger firms, high-technology firms, and those firms with
        higher percentage of equity offerings. This pattern seems consistent with
        more risk-aversion of female investors compared to male ones. Furthermore,

        analyze the influence of rate regulation on insurance demand in an annuity
        setting. With a unique dataset containing a natural experiment due to German
        federal regulation and the E.U. Gender Directive we study the impact of unisex
        tariffs on contract choices in variable annuity products. Our data contains
        two different choice variables with antithetic predictions for men and women,
        meaning that women should increase their demand in one choice and decrease
        it in the other, while men should exhibit opposite behavior. We find with
        regard to both choices that both men and women have lower demand for guarantees
        within the annuity in unisex contracts than without rate regulation. This
        behavior contradicts economic intuition. We hypothesize that the effect could
        instead be explained by the public perception of unisex tariffs.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        a similar movement of returns in the latter. In particular, we postulate that
        in the recent crisis, an extreme downside movement in a major market affected
        other markets, and that these effects intensified. Our empirical results based

        Funds Rate Shocks: The 2007-2009 Financial Crisis</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624491</link><description>This
        empirically motivated doctoral thesis investigates the impact of Federal Funds
        rate (FFR) surprises on asset prices between Jun-89 to Dec-12, with a focus
        on the effect of the 2007-2009 financial crisis on this relationship. This
        is an important question to evaluate because the Fed initially responded to
        the crisis by using conventional monetary policy (i.e. target FFR cuts) to
        influence financial, monetary and economic conditions in the broader macroeconomy.
        This was also the primary policy tool of the Fed throughout the majority of
        the crisis period (Sep-07 to Dec-08) and non-conventional monetary policy
        measures were only used when the target FFR approached the zero-lower bound.
        In Chapter 1 we outline the thesis and in Chapter 2 we review empirical studies
        related to this thesis. Chapter 3 is the first empirical chapter of this thesis
        in which we investigate the impact of FFR surprises on US stock returns. We
        demonstrate that a structural shift occurred during the recent crisis which
        significantly altered the US stock market response to FFR shocks. In particular,
        stock returns were shown to be associated with non-positive or negative responses
        to unexpected FFR cuts during the crisis. The lack of a positive stock response
        to FFR shocks during the crisis implies that unexpected FFR cuts ceased to
        be seen as good news by stock market investors, and were rather interpreted
        as signals from the Fed of worsening macro-financial conditions. We extend
        our empirical analysis to the US Treasury market and gold market in Chapter
        4. Our estimates show that very short-term maturity (3-Month), longer-term
        (5-Year, 10-Year and 30-Year) maturity Treasury yields and gold returns were
        associated with significantly larger magnitude declines in response to unexpected
        FFR cuts during the crisis. The stronger response of these securities to FFR
        shocks during the crisis implies that unexpected FFR cuts signalled worsening
        future economic prospects and triggered a rebalancing of investment portfolios
        away from falling equities and towards these safe-haven assets. These cuts
        prompted significantly higher demand for highly liquid securities such as
        3-Month T-Bills and gold. The stronger response of longer-term Treasuries
        implies that investors anticipated a prolonged downturn and increased demand
        for longer-term, lower-risk, safe-haven assets. Finally in Chapter 5 we consider
        the international context, investigating the transmission of FFR shocks to
        equity indices across 43 advanced and emerging market countries. We find substantial
        cross country heterogeneity in the responses of foreign equity index returns
        to FFR shocks outside the crisis, with positive stock responses to FFR shocks
        where significant. However, we find even greater heterogeneity in the responses
        of foreign equity indices to FFR shocks during the crisis, with an unexpected
        1% FFR cut being associated with significant 2.53%-7.50% decline across the
        equity indices of 12 countries, and 2.79%-14.04% increases across the equity
        indices of 19 countries. Our estimates show that cross country heterogeneity
        in equity market responses to FFR shocks during the crisis period can only
        partly be explained in terms of real bilateral integration with the US economy,
        and find that external borrowing from the rest of the world is also an important
        determinant. Overall, our estimates in this thesis highlight the severity
        of the 2007-2009 crisis, reveal the limits of conventional monetary policy
        at the zero lower bound and are consistent with the Keynesian liquidity trap
        theory.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:54:29 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>The

        article that appeared in the July 2015 issue of the Law Quarterly Review is
        a slightly revised version of the 2015 Scarman lecture delivered by the author
        in the Great Hall of the Middle Temple in March 2015. It reviews the origins
        of the Law Commissions Act 1965(U.K.) and analyses how successful the Commissions
        have been. While the performance of the Commissions is found to be creditable,
        the article argues that after 50 years the experience with the Commissions
        has not matched the original vision. Codification was one of the original
        aims but has not been achieved. The explanation for failing to reform the
        law as envisaged lies in the control over legislation exerted by the Executive
        and Parliament. New methods are suggested for designing and processing legislation,
        methods that follow the processes developed by Law Commissions in the Commonwealth.
        Good governance and the rule of law require that legislation be made in a
        more transparent, systematic and rigorous way that ensures high quality, durable
        law. That can be accomplished only by parliamentary reform.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        System and the Available International Policy Options for Emerging Countries</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624510</link><description>This
        paper discusses how the available international monetary policy options for
        emerging countries changed over time during the post-Bretton Woods era in
        view of the trilemma. Upon the liberalization of the emerging countries&#8217;
        capital account, emerging countries suffered from excess volatility and economic
        crisis. They piled up reserves to survive in the region of free international
        capital mobility, but further reserve accumulation might not be sustainable
        in the future. Preventing the negative consequences of highly volatile international
        capital flows by providing global liquidity properly will dictate the available
        policy combinations for emerging countries. A fundamental reform on the international
        monetary and global liquidity provision systems will assist emerging countries
        in coping with liberalized capital accounts. However, the implementation of
        such a reform will take a long time. In this case, properly developed financial
        safety nets may help emerging countries in the interim. Otherwise, emerging
        countries have no choice but to impose capital controls. Advanced countries
        should understand the emerging countries&#8217; options and strive with these
        countries to implement an international monetary system reform that can reflect
        the recent worldwide developments.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015

        differs depending on the data sources used. Results from the aggregate data
        indicate that, on average, wages have been flexible. By contrast, evidence
        from the micro data suggests that nominal wages are downwardly rigid most
        of the time. We also find that downward nominal wage rigidity can differ across
        industries at both industry and individual levels. At the individual level,
        wage rigidity is greater in the service than in the manufacturing sector,
        even though the latter exhibits smaller volatility in its rate of wage growth.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        Financial Stability in a Model of Optimal Central Bank Swap Lines</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624514</link><description>The
        main goal of this study is to develop a dynamic equilibrium model of central
        bank swap lines that helps understand the recent observed behaviors of foreign
        reserves and to analyze the potential effect of the Federal Reserves&#8217;
        foreign exchange swap lines on the determination of international reserves
        and exchange rates. The model focuses on the issue of moral hazard that can
        arise with the liquidity provision of the Federal Reserve through its swap
        lines with other central banks. This study argues that a standard debt contract
        under asymmetric information between lenders and borrowers may not work to
        model actual swap lines between the Federal Reserve and foreign central banks
        because lenders tend to accept credit risks in debt contract models. This
        study shows that debt contracts between the Federal Reserve and foreign central
        banks are inferior to swap contracts in the presence of the informational
        advantage of foreign central banks for local financial institutions in their
        jurisdictions. Although the proposed model is primarily intended to understand
        the contractual relation between the Federal Reserve and foreign central banks,
        it can also serve as a determination model for the nominal exchange rate.
        A policy implication of this model is that short-run and long-run channels
        are available through which the expectation formation of agents is affected
        by the behavior of international reserves and the credible long-term stance
        of the monetary policy.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:55:10 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Strategic

        study introduces a new dataset of bilateral value added trade costs for the
        goods and services sectors, based on a measure derived from the micro-founded
        gravity model and using data from the OECD-WTO TiVA database. This is the
        first study to calculate value added trade costs for a set of developed and
        developing economies, both for the goods and services sectors. Overall, we
        find that, in the goods sector and in absolute term, international trade costs
        calculated using value added data are lower than those calculated using gross
        trade and output data. However, in relative term, bilateral trade costs remain
        broadly similar regardless of the trade data employed, with trade costs of
        Republic of Korea and Malaysia consistently outperforming all other developing
        countries &#8211; as well as most developed countries &#8211; included in
        the dataset. Value added trade costs are declining over time across most countries
        and regional groups and integration into global supply chains and production
        networks is found to be clearly associated with lower value added trade costs.
        The agricultural sector is characterised by substantially higher trade costs
        than in both manufacturing and services sectors. In turn, value added trade
        costs are found to be slightly higher in services than in manufacturing, although
        substantial cross-country heterogeneity is observed at the sub-sectoral level.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        study extends Wang (2015) by analyzing how a social security system consisting
        of a public pension, child subsidy, and unemployment insurance affects endogenous
        fertility and unemployment when the wage level is endogenously set by monopolistic
        trade unions in an overlapping generations model. The analysis reveals, first,
        that increased pension levels lead to a higher fertility rate when wages are
        higher but a lower rate when wages are lower. Second, an increased child subsidy
        leads to an increased fertility rate when wages are lower but a decreased
        rate when wages are higher. Third, the equilibrium unemployment rate is decided
        by the social security tax level. Moreover, to improve social welfare, it
        is preferable to increase public pensions or the child subsidy tax rate and
        reduce the unemployment insurance tax rate when wages are lower, while it
        is preferable to reduce the child subsidy or the unemployment insurance level
        when wages are higher. Therefore, both social security and wage-setting policies
        should be considered in order to improve fertility and reduce unemployment.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        Rate on Consumption</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624556</link><description>The
        paper examines the impact of interest rate on the households consumption.To
        establish the relationship, both descriptive and analytical tools were employed
        by the author and to make it more robust an explanatory variable is added
        to the interest rate because interest rate is not the only determinant of
        consumption.The findings show that there is a negative relationship between
        consumption and interest rate but it has positive relationship with income.
        On the other part,  descriptive tools - bar charts and line graphs - were
        used and the outcome was bi-directional because the relationship is zig-zag
        and this may be as a result of latent economic activities.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        E-Tourism Services: A Case of Taiwan</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624569</link><description>The
        Purpose &#8211; The prompt and efficient changes in technology during the
        past few decades have affected tourism industry. With new emerging technologies
        (internet) the method of doing business has changed; which makes it a very
        important factor to understand the consumer behavior and perception in order
        to recognize, captivate, and retain the customers in the internet based traveling
        industry. This paper examines the determinants which influence the consumer
        behavior of the potential customers to use e-tourism services and to show
        their interrelationship in the perspective of Taiwan.Design/Methodology &#8211;
        Empirical research is been used to determine the findings of this research.
        A questionnaire was designed based on the past studies related to the variables
        of the study. The questionnaire consisted of four sections each consisting
        of four to five statements. The demographic section was also included. A total
        of 402 completed questionnaires were taken into consideration.Findings &#8211;
        The result of this study shows that determinants considered in this study;
        generation of stimulus, information search and service quality have a major
        impact over the loyalty of the consumer which determines the consumer behavior
        towards the e-tourism services for travel planning purposes.Originality of
        the Research &#8211; This is the first kind of research done over consumer
        behavior of youth specifically in e-tourism industry in Taiwan&#8217;s perspective
        and secondly as the data is collected directly from Taiwan&#8217;s youth and
        is empirically evaluated so we believe its results will help the organizations
        for making the e-tourism industry more consumer oriented in case of Taiwan.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        Good Governors?</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624591</link><description>This
        paper empirically evaluates the economic performance of U.S. state governors
        who came to the position from a business background (CEO governors), focusing
        on the growth rate of real personal income per capita, unemployment rate,
        and income inequality. Methodologically, we apply a matching method to account
        for the endogeneity of political selection. Using entropy balancing, we identify
        credible counterfactuals for CEO governors, that is, governors without a business
        background who took office under similar economic and fiscal situations. We
        find, first, that business people tend to take office in times of economic
        and fiscal strain. Second, the tenures of CEO governors are associated with
        a 0.6 percentage points higher annual income growth rate and a 0.6 percentage
        points lower unemployment rate than are the tenures of non-CEO governors.
        Also, state-level income inequality decreases when CEO governors hold office,
        indicating that low-income households benefit from the economic upswing. Third,
        the positive effect of having a CEO governor increases with time in office.
        Fourth, Republican CEO governors perform slightly better than their Democratic
        colleagues.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:55:10 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Modelling
        International Tourism Demand Using Seasonal ARIMA Models</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624593</link><description>Purpose
        &#8211; The purpose of this study is to establish a seasonal autoregressive
        integrated moving average model able to capture and explain the patterns and
        the determinants of German tourism demand in Croatia.Design &#8211; The present
        study is based on the Box-Jenkins approach in building a seasonal autoregressive
        integrated moving average model intend to describe the behaviour of the German
        tourists&#8217; flows to Croatia.Approach &#8211; The proposed model is a
        seasonal ARIMA(0,0,0)(1,1,3)4 model.Findings &#8211; The diagnostic checking
        and the performed tests showed that the estimated seasonal ARIMA(0,0,0)(1,1,3)4
        model is adequate in modelling and analysing the number of German tourists&#8217;
        arrivals to Croatia.Originality of the Paper &#8211; This study provides a
        seasonal ARIMA model helpful to analyse, understand and forecast German tourists&#8217;
        flows to Croatia. Such, more detailed and systematic studies should be considered
        as starting points of future macroeconomic development strategies, pricing
        strategies and tourism sector routing strategies in Croatia, as a predominantly
        tourism oriented country.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:57:28

        Influence: Evidence from a Family Firm Dominated Economy</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624594</link><description>Despite
        the dominance of family-owned publicly listed companies in developing economies,
        prior research has paid relatively little attention to this area, and the
        socio-economic context of these countries has been mostly ignored. This study
        contributes to the accounting literature by providing empirical evidence of
        the effects of family control and ownership on audit pricing and auditor choice
        in a developing economy context. Using 1,058 firm-year observations of publicly
        listed companies in Bangladesh, where family firms are the most dominant form
        of public companies, we determine that in comparison with non-family firms,
        our sample family firms pay significantly lower audit fees and tend to choose
        lower quality auditors. However, for export oriented industries, family firms
        seem to pay significantly higher audit fees and recruit better quality auditors
        compared to non-family firms, indicating stakeholder power. Collectively,
        our findings have important implications for audit markets in emerging economies
        in which the sustainability of family firms is crucial for overall economic
        development.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:56:33 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Audit
        Committee Composition and Functioning Post-Enron</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624708</link><description>The
        role of audit committees is crucial in the financial reporting process. I
        studied a sample of 288 S&amp;P; 500 firms from the period 2000-2002 and 2008-2009
        to identify changes in audit committee composition. I found that directors
        with Audit/CPA and Accounting/Finance experience are sought after and most
        firms continue to add audit committee financial experts to their audit committees;
        in many instances, such additions happen in companies that already have multiple
        audit committee financial experts. This suggests that although it is challenging
        to find audit committee financial experts it is not impossible as some critics
        may have suggested in the past when the definition of who is an audit committee
        financial expert was under debate. I also examined the frequency of audit
        committee meetings in 2000-2002 and 2008-2009. It was important to look at
        changes in audit committee meetings in the post-Enron period because companies
        were likely to revert to reducing costs and reduce audit committee meetings.
        However, I found that the number of audit committee meetings has continued
        to increase, contrary to concerns that audit committees would become less
        diligent with the passage of time.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015

        Volatility Premiums with VIX Options</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624713</link><description>This
        study examines the efficiency of VIX option trading strategies that exploit
        the VIX futures roll and the often substantial VIX futures volatility premiums
        from January 2007 through March 2014. The study first assesses the related
        issue of whether VIX options typically are overpriced by examining long VIX
        option delta-hedged returns and demonstrates that average losses on front
        contract calls and puts over 5-business day horizons either are not statistically
        significant or are economically small. In light of the evidence that VIX option
        buyers on average do not overpay at all or by much for the limited risk associated
        with VIX options, the study then turns to whether long VIX option positions
        can be used to exploit the well-documented tendencies of VIX futures to rise
        and fall when the VIX futures curve is in backwardation and in contango, respectively,
        as well as the tendency of VIX futures to build in large ex-ante volatility
        premiums.  The results demonstrate that these defined-risk strategies are
        highly profitable and offer attractive risk-reward tradeoffs.  Moreover, the
        systematic tendencies of VIX futures have far more power for predicting attractive
        VIX option returns than the ex-ante volatility premiums built into VIX options.  The
        study also shows that long VIX option strategies importantly benefit from
        a strong tailwind that owes to the tendency of VIX option implied volatilities
        to rise with increases in the actual volatilities of underlying VIX futures
        contracts, as VIX futures move toward settlement and their volatilities rise
        to the typically higher volatility of the VIX.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        estimate the effects on postsecondary education outcomes of the Kalamazoo
        Promise, a generous place-based college scholarship. We identify Promise effects
        using difference-in-differences, comparing eligible to ineligible graduates
        before and after the Promise&#8217;s initiation. According to our estimates,
        the Promise significantly increases college enrollment, college credits attempted,
        and credential attainment. Stronger effects occur for minorities and women.
        Predicted lifetime earnings effects of the Promise&#8217;s credential gains,
        compared to the Promise&#8217;s scholarship costs, represent an internal rate
        of return of 11.3 percent. Based on our results, simple and generous scholarships

        Control Reporting and Audit Fees of Non-Accelerated Filers</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624731</link><description>Recent
        actions by regulators and legislators reflect the belief that compliance with
        Section 404 of SOX is quite costly for non-accelerated filers. In this paper,
        we examine (a) the associations between the presence and remediation of internal
        control problems and audit fees for non-accelerated filers, and (b) how such
        associations differ for non-accelerated filers from those for accelerated
        filers. Using data from fiscal years 2008 and 2009, we find that the audit
        fee premium for non-accelerated filers disclosing a material weakness in internal
        controls (a) is significantly lower than the corresponding premium paid by
        accelerated filers, and (b) declines significantly over time only for the
        non-accelerated filers. We also examine subsequent remediation of internal
        control problems and find that in the case of accelerated filers remediating
        clients pay lower fees compared to clients continuing to report internal control
        problems; however, such differences are not observed in the case of non-accelerated
        filers. Overall, our findings suggest that the market for audit services differs
        significantly for non-accelerated filers than from the audit market for accelerated
        filers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:57:45 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Choice
        of Enterprise Form: Spain, 1886-1936</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624746</link><description>Economists
        have long neglected study of an important contractual decision, a firm&#8217;s
        choice of legal form. Enterprise form shapes the relations among a firm&#8217;s
        owners as well as many features of a firm&#8217;s interactions with the rest
        of the economy. Using unusual firm-level data on Spain 1886-1936, we estimate
        nested logit models of the determinants of enterprise form choice. In 1919,
        Spain introduced a new enterprise form that compromised between partnerships
        and corporations, and displaced larger partnerships and smaller corporations.
        This Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada was especially important for small
        and median-sized enterprises whose owners were not related.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        Self-Inflicted Wound</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624750</link><description>In
        a 2014 opinion (ATP Tour, Inc. v. Deutscher Tennis Bund), the Delaware Supreme
        Court upheld a fee-shifting bylaw, which required unsuccessful shareholder
        litigants in either derivative or direct actions to reimburse the corporation
        for its legal expenses. Although the entity in question was a non-profit,
        non-stock corporation, most observers expected the Delaware courts to extend
        that holding to for-profit stock corporations. In the months that followed,
        about 50 Delaware corporations adopted such bylaws.In its 2015 legislative
        session, however, the Delaware legislature adopted amendments to the Delaware
        General Corporation Law (S.B. 75) that effectively bans such bylaws. This
        article argues that this ban is contrary to sound public policy and adverse
        to Delaware&#8217;s own interests. It then advances an interest group analysis,
        focusing on the power of the Delaware bar, to explain why the Delaware legislature
        would have inflicted such a serious wound on itself. This analysis leads to
        two take-home lessons. First, if it wishes to ensure that future legislation
        advances both sound public policy and the state&#8217;s financial interests,
        the Delaware legislature needs to free itself from the bar&#8217;s influence.
        In addition, the business community needs to invest lobbying resources in
        Delaware so as to counter the bar&#8217;s influence in cases such as this.
        Second, states in which the corporate bar wields less legislative influence
        thus may have a significantly easier time adopting legislation authorizing
        such bylaws. If so, the likelihood that S.B. 75 will significantly reduce
        Delaware&#8217;s dominance of corporate law will go up substantially.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        112 Standards Won''t Help the Case for Software Patents</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624758</link><description>Critics
        of software patents charge that they are too often vague and written in abstract,
        functional terms.  Legitimate in certain cases, the criticism of software
        patents has gained traction in the U.S. Supreme Court. See Alice Corp. Pty
        Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int''l, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014); Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S.
        593 (2010). As the weapon of choice for eliminating suspect software patents,
        the Court has tendered an "abstract idea" exclusion from patent-eligible subject
        matter under 35 U.S.C. &#167;101. Unfortunately, the Court&#8217;s abstract
        idea filter is itself abstract, ill-defined, and vague. In Mayo Collab. Servs.
        v. Prometheus Labs, Inc., 132 S. Ct. 1289 (2012), the Supreme Court rejected
        the argument that patent law already had a satisfactory statutory rule to
        rein in vague patent claims &#8212; 35 U.S.C. &#167;112, first paragraph,
        which sets forth the enablement and written description of the invention requirements.
        The Court failed to appreciate that more rigorous application of &#167;112
        standards could result in a significant winnowing of ambiguous, vague software
        patents. In this brief commentary on a recent Federal Circuit software enablement
        case, Vasudevan Software, Inc. v. MicroStrategy, Inc., 782 F.3d 671 (Fed.
        Cir. April 3, 2015), we contend that the appellate court further damaged the
        cause for greater reliance on &#167;112 standards to police software patents.
        In our view, the Federal Circuit in Vasudevan Software wrongly resuscitated
        patents that were likely invalid for failing to comply with the &#167;112
        disclosure requirements. Unfortunately, Vasudevan Software tends to prove
        the Supreme Court&#8217;s point &#8212; that &#167;112, at least as it is
        being applied, is not working as an adequate policing mechanism for software
        patents. This must change.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:57:09

        Bubbles: An Experiment in Forensic Finance</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624760</link><description>The
        notion of bubbles is ubiquitous in the public discussion of finance. Yet,
        the empirical discovery of bubbles is notoriously difficult. The main shortcoming
        of the current approaches is that they rely on the estimation of the &#8220;fundamental
        value of an asset&#8221;, which is hard to estimate and interpret. In 2006-2007,
        Jarrow, Protter and Shimbo (JPS) proposed another approach to bubbles, one,
        which does not rely on the notion of the fundamental value of an asset. In
        2008, the author developed two hypotheses (or theorems) connecting the JPS
        approach with the serial correlations in returns of specially designed assets.
        These hypotheses were tested by the author on a proverbial example of the
        Nasdaq index in 1999-2001 &#8212; the time of a hypothetical dot-com bubble.
        By this work, I continue this study by applying informational criteria to
        the cases of a sharp drop in oil prices in the end of 1980s and the beginning
        of 1990s. The sharp drop in oil prices can indicate unknown fundamental factors
        in oil prices, or a negative bubble. While the application of JPS theory to
        negative bubbles is tenuous, a sheer possibility that the subject of a negative
        bubble can be empirically studied for commodities, offers a fascinating glimpse
        into the market behavior.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:54:42

        &#8211; the doctrine that military attacks must not cause &#8220;excessive&#8221;
        harm to civilian life and property &#8211; was not mentioned in any international
        convention on the law of armed conflict until Additional Protocol I (1977).
        Commentaries by the Red Cross depict AP I&#8217;s rule as a return to traditional
        understandings, implicitly repudiating their abandonment by the western Allies
        in the Second World War. The historical record is quite different. Leading
        commentators before the Second World War endorsed food blockades and massive
        destruction of infrastructure. American military commentators, down to the
        1970s, assessed World War II practice as broadly consistent with international
        law. At the time it was negotiated, AP-I was not seen as a radical departure
        from Twentieth Century practice. It should not be interpreted to impose disabling
        constraints on contemporary military action. Different military challenges
        justify different levels of harm to civilians. The context of military action
        must matter as much as any abstract formula like &#8220;proportionality.&#8221;</description><pubDate>Wed,

        study investigates a competitive scenario when two firms facing stochastic
        demand are concerned not only with their own profits but also with their chances
        to make a higher profit than the other. We model this situation as a game
        between two newsvendors operating on isolated markets but affecting each other
        via a social comparison and characterize the equilibria in the simultaneous
        and sequential versions of the game. The key factor driving the outcomes is
        intransitivity of preferences, resembling those in Rock-Paper-Scissors and
        Dollar Auction games. We also conduct two experiments that (i) test the hypothesis
        that such competition may arise without any monetary incentives, purely as
        a result of humans'' intrinsic competitiveness, and (ii) explore whether such
        social preferences can be easily mitigated. The experimental data provide
        strong evidence of the intrinsic competitiveness hypothesis and indicate that
        possibilities for its mitigation exist but may be limited.We hope this study
        may be of interest for both practicing managers and academics. First, it provides
        insights into a number situations that involve explicit or implicit bonuses,
        from inventory managers competing for a promotion to CEOs of hi-tech giants
        deciding how much to invest into a specific technology. Adding to the information-sharing
        literature, it shows why forcing the best employees to share their decisions
        ("best-practices") with the rest might hurt the overall performance of the
        company. Second, because the players'' best-response in this game is most
        often to order "a tiny bit closer to the median demand", this suggests that
        social comparison can be yet another factor contributing to "pull-to-center"
        effect reported from in newsvendor experiments.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        35 index, for a period of 14 years -- from 2001 until 2014. The period under
        study includes episodes of volatility and instability in financial markets,
        incorporating the Global Financial Crisis and the European Sovereign Debt
        Crisis. This implies a challenge in portfolio optimization strategies since
        the methodologies are restricted to the assignment of positive weights. We
        have taken for asset allocation the daily returns with an estimation window
        equal to 1 year and we hold portfolio assets for another year. We evaluate
        the out-of-sample performance of 15 strategies for asset allocation in the
        Ibex 35 index, before and after of the Global Financial Crisis. Our results
        suggest that a large number of strategies outperform to the 1/N rule and to
        the Ibex 35 index in terms of return, Sharpe ratio and lower VaR and CVaR.
        The mean-variance portfolio of Markowitz with shortsale constraints, it is
        the only strategy that renders a Sharpe ratio statistically different to Ibex
        35 index in the 2001-2007 and 2008-2014 periods.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        and Financial Crisis in a Dynamic Model</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624901</link><description>The
        paper models foreign capital inflow in a multi-period framework from the developed
        to the developing countries. The market for foreign loan together with the
        foreign exchange market simultaneously determines interest rate in the international
        loan market and the exchange rate. We also derive the conditions for existence
        of meaningful equilibrium solutions. Because of non-linearity of the functions
        we adopt a numerical solution method. A number of comparative dynamic analyses
        explore the impact of parameters of the model on the endogenous variables.
        The model is then used to explain the possibility of financial crisis originating
        either in the developed country or in the developing country. The explanation
        of crisis in this structure is based on trade theoretic terms in a dynamic
        terms of trade framework rather than in terms of informational imperfections.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        and Innovative Work Behavior: A Multi-Level Study on Karasek''s Learning Hypothesis</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624902</link><description>As
        employees&#8217; behaviour is a crucial factor for organizational success,
        the question on how to promote the engagement of employees in their work and
        boost their implication in the innovation process is central for companies.
        In this article we study this question building on the Karasek model suggesting
        that employees in jobs with high autonomy and time pressure will be more engaged
        and more innovative. The results of the multi-level regression analyses confirm
        that such a combination is associated with high employee innovation. For work
        engagement, the job autonomy helps in buffering the negative effects of time
        pressure.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:56:48 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Investing
        in the Cleanest Form of Energy: Efficiency Practices of SMEs in Rural Ghana</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624904</link><description>Efficiency
        has been identified as the cheapest and cleanest source of fuel. Whilst effort
        has been made in the advanced countries to promote technology and efficiency,
        little is known about efficiency in emerging economies in Africa. The purpose
        of this study is to identify the energy efficiency practices of SMEs in rural
        Ghana and also examine the barriers to energy efficiency practices. First,
        a descriptive analysis was used to examine the barriers and energy efficiency
        indicators. Second, autometrics is used to examine the relationship between
        energy efficiency and productivity at the aggregate level. The study finds
        that lack of information on energy efficiency practices is the most important
        barrier to energy efficiency. On the practices, methods such as putting off
        electrical appliances when not in use or when closed, using new electrical
        appliances and using less appliances to achieve the same goal are some of
        the common ones adopted by SMEs in rural Ghana. The study recommends that
        the Ghana Energy Commission should intensify its energy efficiency education
        and extend this to rural areas.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:58:11

        Crowdinvesting: An Analysis of Innovestment Backers</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624908</link><description>In
        this paper, we analyze the pricing of cash flow rights in startup companies
        based on a unique dataset of crowdinvesting backers. Our sample consists of
        44 campaigns and includes 1,450 bids made by 499 backers during the period
        from November 6, 2011 to March 25, 2014 on the German crowdinvesting portal
        Innovestment. In contrast to all other European crowdinvesting portals, Innovestment
        is running a multiunit sealed bid second price auction where backers can specify
        the price they are willing to pay for an investment ticket with the portal
        and startup specifying a lower threshold. We exploit this unique auction mechanism
        to analyze backers&#8217; willingness to pay for cash flow rights in a startup
        company. We find that campaign characteristics, investor sophistication, progress
        in funding, herding, and stock market volatility influence backers&#8217;
        willingness to pay in an economically meaningful fashion, whereas we do not
        find any evidence for a local bias or sniping at the end of an auction. Our
        findings indicate that portal design and self-regulation might well trump
        government rules in the pursuit to protect investors.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        objective of this study is to identify and analyse the determinant factors
        of Indonesian oil and gas foreign direct investment (FDI) and its impacts
        on the Indonesian competitiveness. The flow of FDI in oil and gas has been
        increased dramatically in the last five years. However, the distribution of
        FDI is highly unequal and the competition among countries to attract foreign
        investors is fairly high. This study is based on quantitative survey of 245
        samples from employee that worked in foreign oil and gas companies in Indonesia.
        Descriptive analysis was presented to explore the overall performance of country
        competitiveness, as well as the relationship among variables. The finding
        of this study showed that government, infrastructure, location and human resources

        purpose &#8211; Slovenian tourism organisations must constantly focus on developing
        variety innovations for organisations. In this paper, we present a study conducted
        on innovation practices in Slovenian tourism organisations.Design/methodology
        &#8211; In a survey conducted on Slovenia tourism organisations, we obtained
        data and identified their innovation performance and the innovation climate
        in their area of business. There are three main hypothesis tested.Findings
        &#8211; The research sample of 41 organisations found that most innovation
        in tourism organisations came through the introduction of new services (90%),
        followed by innovation through new organisational methods (73%), and found
        a high-level climate for innovation. Worse was its assessment of research
        activity within organisations and cooperation with external institutions (eg.
        universities and research institutes) and investment in innovation activities
        within their research and development. Results obtained from the research
        showed a mean value for the innovation climate-instrument of 3.83 indicating
        a high innovation climate for the Slovenian tourism companies included in
        the sample survey. Mostly, (publicly known as) more innovative active organisations
        responded to our survey. From such results, we find that tourism organisations
        included in the survey are aware of the importance of innovation, teaching
        organisations to communicate well and network with other organisations, are
        adaptable to change and engaged with their own ideas in support of the organisation''s
        management. Originality of the research &#8211; The contribution of the research
        is that it has applied the generic instrument for measuring innovation climate
        on tourism and the first time climate is measured in Slovenia.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        purpose &#8211; The purpose of this paper is to understand the meaning of
        dark and memorial tourism better, as well as to create basic preconditions
        for relatively new concept of tourism in Croatia, as dark and memorial tourism
        is well defined subject internationally.Design &#8211; The theoretical background
        of the topic is been presented, and further institutional support for the
        development of memorial tourism. The special focus is given to analysis of
        the factors that influence the implementation of memorial tourism in area
        of regional economic development strategy according to the principles of triple
        helix but also quintuple helix cooperation &#8211; this type of tourism rely
        on support from the institutions, official tourism associations and local
        communities.Methodology/approach &#8211; Recent scientific literature analyzed
        in the paper (memorial tourism, dark tourism, thanatourism, phoenix tourism)
        present new advances and research results in the field of memorial tourism
        as theoretical reflection of good (best) international practice. It determines
        the views of the authors referring to the new trends of modern tourism consumers.
        Vukovar-Srijem County as a space of political and cultural importance allows,
        through its touristic production and consumption, for a ritual space that
        exists outside of time (&#8220;heritage that hurts&#8221;, &#8220;life-changing
        points of shock&#8221;, Stone, 2014). After identifying and analysing both
        the existing resources of the region and institutional requirements for potential
        development of memorial tourism a management proposal will be made for the
        development of a new concept of tourism in Croatia.Findings &#8211; According
        to the data of the Ministry of War Veterans of the Republic of Croatia (2013),
        up to May 18, 2011, 143 mass graves have been found in the Republic of Croatia,
        most of them in Vukovar-Srijem County. Inadequate cooperation between the
        tourism stakeholders and university sector, at regional i.e. national level
        and veterans&#8217; associations as the main drivers of development of memorial
        centres resulted in inadequately developed tourism product.Originality of
        the research &#8211; In the paper marketing is used as a mechanism to achieve
        strategic objectives of destination regions and thus, should be guided by
        the policies for regional development. The triple helix and quintuple helix
        innovation paradigm is based on the integration of commercialization, empirical
        knowledge, public good and civil society. To facilitate the development of
        memorial tourism, it is recommended to strengthen the cooperation with scientific
        institutions both in regional and national level in order to establish the
        facts and prevent further dissemination of occasionally false information
        about war time events and as a return measure suggest an acceptable marketing
        mix of memorial tourism product. Furthermore, tourism businesses, especially
        tourist agencies, have to become involved in receptive tourist programmes
        as soon as possible. Namely, the majority of tourist agencies are oriented
        towards emissive business operations. It is evident, though, that nothing
        can be done without a source of financing and coordination that can be provided
        by regional administration.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:57:28

        Life Cycle &#8211; Input-Output Analysis to Predict the Environmental Impacts
        of Energy Policy Scenarios</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624939</link><description>Nowadays,
        many countries adopt an active agenda to mitigate the impact of greenhouse
        gas emissions by moving towards less polluting energy generation technologies.
        The environmental costs, directly or indirectly generated to achieve such
        a challenging objective, remain however largely underexplored. Until now,
        research has focused either on pure economic approaches such as computable
        general equilibrium (CGE) and partial equilibrium (PE) models, or on (physical)
        energy supply scenarios. These latter could be used to evaluate the environmental
        impacts of various energy saving or cleaner technologies via life cycle assessment
        (LCA) methodology. These modelling efforts have, however, been pursued in
        isolation, without exploring the possible complementarities and synergies.
        In this study, we have undertaken a practical combination of these approaches
        into a common framework: on the one hand, by coupling a CGE with a PE model,
        and, on the other hand, by linking the outcomes from the coupling with a hybrid
        input-output-process based life cycle inventory. The methodological framework
        aimed at assessing the environmental consequences of two energy policy scenarios
        in Luxembourg between 2010 and 2025. The study highlights the potential of
        coupling CGE and PE models but related methodological difficulties (e.g. small
        number of available technologies in Luxembourg, intrinsic limitations of the
        two approaches, etc.). The assessment shows both environmental synergies and
        trade-offs due to the implementation of energy policies. For example, despite
        the changes in technologies towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions,
        only marginal improvements are observed in the climate change mitigation scenario
        as compared to the business-as-usual. The energy related production and imports
        are indeed expected to increase over time and represent a large contribution
        to the country&#8217;s impacts. Interestingly, side effects on other impacts
        than climate change or fossil resource depletion (e.g. ionising radiation
        and water depletion) may also occur mainly due to the use of nuclear energy
        in neighbouring countries.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:54:29

        &#8211; The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to which the
        largest Romanian travel agencies communicate their CSR practices and policies
        in the online environment, as reflected by the contents of their websites
        and social media pages, outlining the manner of this online disclosure within
        specific CSR domains.Design &amp; methodology &#8211; The websites and social
        media pages of the largest Romanian travel agencies, in terms of net turnover,
        were analyzed considering several variables related to CSR communication/disclosure:
        having a CSR dedicated section, including CSR reports, emphasizing legal and
        economic responsibilities, and disclosing workforce, society, market, and
        environment oriented CSR actions or policies.Findings &#8211; The research
        reveals significant deficiencies and superficiality in communicating CSR in
        the online environment by the investigated organizations. Only 10% dedicate
        a section on their website to CSR, none of them include any form of CSR reports,
        while the most frequent CSR aspects comprised in their online domains can
        be categorized as market-oriented, service quality being the most emphasized
        facet, fair pricing and honest/transparent communication being also consistently
        outlined.Originality of the research &#8211; Research on how the members of
        the tourism distribution sector communicate CSR in the online environment
        with focus on Central and Eastern Europe has been extremely scarce. This paper&#8217;s
        contribution consists in reducing this literature gap, bringing insights into
        CSR communication practices from the Central and Eastern European tourism
        distribution sector. Moreover, the proposed methodology for analyzing travel

        Change and Tourism Adaptation: Literature Review</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624944</link><description>Purpose
        &#8211; This paper reviews published English literature on tourism adaptation
        to climate change. Climate change remains a challenge in the 21st century
        and beyond. Climate sensitive industries like tourism are vulnerable to climate
        change. It is for this reason that tourism researchers have continued to explore
        the relationship between tourism and climate change and further explored response
        strategies among tourism stakeholders. Tourism research on climate change
        adaptation may be traces way back in the 1960s. However, focused research
        on climate change and tourism has emerged in the last 15 years.Design &#8211;
        This review maps tourism adaptation knowledge domains between early1960s and
        2014.Methodology &#8211; This paper rely on secondary English published tourism
        literature to aid the review.Findings &#8211; Findings indicate that tourism
        adaptation literature have advanced under five thematic areas prior 2010 to
        include: Business adaptation; Consumer adaptation, Destination adaptation,
        Adaptation policy and Frameworks for adaptation. However, after 2010 a new
        theme on &#8216;sustainable adaptation&#8217; is tourism has emerged and it
        is gaining attention among tourism researchers.Originality &#8211; The originality
        of this paper is that the paper is the first paper in tourism that has identified
        sustainable adaptation as a new emerging thematic area in tourism and climate
        change adaptation research. The paper notes an emergence of interest on sustainable
        adaptation knowledge domain despite lack of clarity on what is sustainable
        adaptation within tourism research. It is therefore important for researchers
        to amicably define the term sustainable adaptation to enable comparative studies
        and discourse in the area.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:57:28

        Law</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624945</link><description>Contracts
        lie at the heart of the regulatory system governing the creation and dissemination
        of cultural products in two respects: (1) The exclusive rights provided by
        copyright law only turn into financial reward, and thus incentives to creators,
        through a contract with a third party to exploit protected material. (2) From
        a user perspective purchases of protected material may take the form of a
        licensing contract, governing behaviour after the initial transaction. Thus,
        a review of the relationship between copyright and contract law has to address
        both supply- and demand-side issues. On the supply side, policy concerns include
        whether copyright law delivers the often stated aim of securing the financial
        independence of creators. Particularly acute are the complaints by both creators
        and producers that they fail to benefit from the exponential increase in the
        availability of copyright materials on the Internet.  On the demand side,
        the issue of copyright exceptions and their policy justification has become
        central to a number of reviews and consultations dealing with digital content.
        Are exceptions based on user needs or market failure? Do exceptions require
        financial compensation? Can exceptions be contracted out by licence agreements?This
        report (i) reviews economic theory of contracts, value chains and transaction
        costs, (ii) identifies a comprehensive range of regulatory options relating
        to creator and user contracts, using an international comparative approach,

        and (iv) where no evidence is available, extrapolates predicted effects from

        Private Ordering Solution to Multiforum Shareholder Litigation</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624951</link><description>This
        paper empirically analyzes a private ordering solution to multiforum shareholder
        litigation: exclusive forum provisions in corporate charters and bylaws. These
        provisions, whose use has become quite widespread, require that all corporate
        law-related disputes be brought in a single forum, typically a court in the
        statutory domicile. Using hand-collected data on the 746 U.S. public corporations
        that have adopted the provision, we examine what drives the growth in these
        provisions and whether, as some critics contend, their adoption reflects managerial
        opportunism. We separately analyze companies that adopt the provision at the
        IPO stage (which usually occurs through a charter amendment) and those that
        adopt &#8220;midstream&#8221; or after IPO stage (which usually occurs through
        a bylaw amendment).We find that nearly all new Delaware corporations adopt
        the provision at the IPO stage, and further that the transition from zero
        to near-universal IPO adoption is driven by law firms. The characteristics
        of individual companies appear to play little or no role in adoption decisions.
        Instead, the pattern of adoption follows what can be described as a light
        switch model, in which law firms suddenly switch from never adopting to always
        adopting the provision in the IPOs they advise. This pattern contrasts with
        the decision to include takeover defenses in IPO charters, and suggests that
        lawyers have come to perceive that exclusive forum provisions are universally
        value-increasing.For midstream adoptions, we compare corporate governance
        features of midstream bylaw adopters to a matched sample of non-adopters in
        order to test the hypothesis that midstream bylaw adoption reflects managerial
        opportunism. If the hypothesis were correct, then we would expect to find
        that midstream adopters exhibit poor corporate governance compared to nonadopters
        (using the metrics of good governance practices as identified by critics of
        the provisions). We find, however, that there are either no significant differences
        in governance or that it is actually adopters that have higher quality governance
        features. We also find no significant differences in governance and ownership
        structures between firms whose boards adopt the provisions as bylaws and those
        who obtain shareholder approval. The absence of significant differences across
        firms using disparate adoption procedures suggests that the method of adopting
        an exclusive forum provision &#8211; whether with or without shareholder approval
        &#8211; should not be a matter of import for investors.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        and compare several common earnings quality measures: value relevance, persistence,
        predictability, smoothness, and discretionary accruals. We use a rational
        expectations framework in which a manager has market price, earnings, and
        smoothing incentives and can bias earnings reports. Taking the information
        content of reported earnings as a natural benchmark, we determine how variations
        of management incentives, operating risk, and accounting noise affect earnings
        quality and examine whether the different measures point in the same or in
        the opposite direction. We find that value relevance and persistence are measures
        that are closely aligned with each other and with our benchmark, followed
        by predictability and smoothness. Discretionary accruals measures are less
        aligned because they are based on the level of accruals, which confounds their
        information content. Our results also support the notion that smoother earnings
        and higher discretionary accruals are associated with greater earnings quality.</description><pubDate>Wed,

        Caught between Company Performance and the Economic Situation &#8211; Evidence
        from Germany</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624964</link><description>This
        research explores the impact of both company profitability and economic situation
        on the degree of future orientation in company reporting and the textual emphasis
        within forward-looking statements (company-external vs. company-specific prospective
        information). To this end, the annual reports of all German HDAX companies
        for the period 2003-2012 were examined. The results of the regression analyses
        reveal that future orientation in company reporting seems to be in tandem
        with company profitability and general improvement of the economic situation.
        Hence, companies in an advantageous position send signals of long-lasting
        positive developments to capital markets. Results pertaining to textual emphasis
        of companies&#8217; forward-looking reporting demonstrate that the degree
        of forward-looking statements related to the external environment of a company
        increases with a rise in the company&#8217;s profitability, but also with
        a worsening of the general economic situation. In contrast, the degree of
        forward-looking statements related to the internal situation of the company
        increases with an improvement in the overall economic scenario, and increases
        further if associated with the company&#8217;s profitability. Thus, prospective
        reporting focuses on the company&#8217;s environment more strongly only if
        the economic situation is in decline (problem-oriented attention control)
        or if the current advantageous position of the company should be preserved
        by considering potential opportunities and risks arising from the company&#8217;s
        environment.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:54:29 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Itchy
        Feet vs Cool Heads: Flow of Funds in an Agent-Based Financial Market</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624975</link><description>Investors
        tend to move funds when they are unhappy with their current portfolio managers''
        performance. We study the effect of the size of this flow of funds in an agent-based
        model of the financial market. The model combines the discrete choice approach
        from agent-based modelling, where all capital is mobile, with the evolutionary
        finance framework where all growth is endogenous. Our results show that a
        small amount of freely flowing capital can have a huge impact on the market
        dynamics. In contrast to the standard model, moreover, clients'' intensity
        of choice has a strong effect even when they exhibit only a very mild recency
        bias.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:54:42 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Keep

        affects contestants'' efforts, and whether the laggard gives up or keeps on
        fighting are key issues. We find that the expected effort of the laggard will
        always be higher than the rival at some stage in the series of contests, and
        this is most likely to happen when at a large disadvantage or at a late stage
        in the series.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:54:42 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>The
        Long-Run Stock Performance of Privatization IPOs</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625007</link><description>This
        paper compares the long-run buy-and-hold returns of privatization initial
        public offerings (IPOs) to those of the domestic stock markets of respective
        countries using a sample of 241 privatization IPOs from 41 countries. The
        evidence indicates that the privatization IPOs significantly outperform their
        domestic stock markets if the returns are equally-weighted while value-weighted
        returns show a sharp reduction in performance. However, there are substantial
        variations in the long-run performance of privatization IPOs across industries,
        issuing countries, issue period, and the origin of commercial law of the country.
        This paper also analyzes the cross-sectional determinants of the long-run
        buy-and-hold returns of privatization shares. The results indicate that the
        long-run performance of privatization IPOs is significantly related to the
        proxies of policy uncertainty, consistent with the signaling models of Perotti
        (1995).</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:56:33 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>The
        Equivalence of Causality Detection in VAR and VECM Modeling with Applications

        error-correction models (VECM) are increasingly being used to capture dynamic
        relationships between financial variables. Estimation and interpretation of
        such models can be enhanced if zero restrictions are allowed in the coefficient
        matrices. Specifically, in tests of indirect causality and/or Granger non-causality
        in a VECM, the efficiency of the causality detection is crucially dependent
        upon finding zero coefficient entries where the true structure does indeed
        include zero entries. Such a VECM is referred to as a zero-non-zero (ZNZ)
        patterned VECM and includes full-order models. Recent advances have shown
        how ZNZ patterns can be explicitly recognized in a VECM and used to provide
        an effective means of detecting Granger-causality, Granger non-causality and
        indirect causality. This paper develops a general approach and framework for
        I(d) integrated systems.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:55:31 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Risk
        Management in Emerging Markets: Practical Methodologies and Empirical Tests</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625014</link><description>Risk
        management has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past fifteen
        years, with most new methods having been designed for the concerns of large
        institutions operating in well-developed financial markets. This paper addresses
        a problem faced by smaller institutions operating in emerging markets, namely
        the significant lack of data. As many risk management techniques are data
        intensive, this problem may seem insurmountable. This paper introduces a new
        method, enriched historical simulation, which supplements the data in an emerging
        market with data from other markets. The principle behind this methodology
        is that when many markets are considered, the essence of emerging market economies
        comes to the fore, with local idiosyncrasies being washed out. This principle
        is illustrated on the problem of estimating Value-at-Risk on the Cyprus and
        Athens Stock Exchanges.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:56:33 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Closed-End
        Country Funds and International Diversification</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625024</link><description>Using
        data from 1993 to 2002 for eight developed and fifteen emerging markets, we
        find that return correlations, mean-variance spanning, and Sharpe ratio tests
        support that closed-end country funds (CECF) can mimic their corresponding
        foreign indices, and that they are more heavily influenced by their corresponding
        local markets instead of the U.S. market. This implies that U.S. investors,
        by investing in CECF, can achieve similar international diversification benefits
        to those achieved by investing directly in the foreign indices. We also document
        increased correlation between the U.S. market and foreign markets during this
        period and find no compelling evidence of economically and statistically significant
        international diversification benefits, as opposed to a pre-1993 period. These
        findings could be associated with the financial market liberalization that
        was prevalent during the period.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:56:33

        Risk</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625030</link><description>n
        this paper we present a model for valuing European and American options, which
        incorporates both default and interest rate risks. We develop a framework
        that permits evaluation of three kinds of options: (i) options issued by default-free
        counterparties on risky bonds, (ii) options issued by risky counterparties
        on default-free bonds and (iii) options issued by risky counterparties on
        risky bonds &#8212; a case where default risk enters at both levels. We show
        that the price of a put option on a risky discount bond is hump shaped for
        a European put and monotone increasing for an American put. We also find that
        the price impact of default risk is less for an American put option than for
        a European one.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:56:33 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>The
        Determinants of Foreign Currency Hedging by U.K. Non-Financial Firms</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625032</link><description>For
        366 large non-financial U.K. firms, this paper reports the factors that are
        important in determining their decision to hedge foreign currency exposure.
        The results provide strong evidence of a relationship between expected financial
        distress costs and the foreign currency hedging decision and more significantly
        the foreign currency only hedging decision. These findings seem stronger than
        those found in similar studies using U.S. data. The paper argues that this
        might be due to the fact that several U.S. studies include in their non-hedging
        sample other hedging firms, such as firms using non-derivative methods for
        currency hedging and interest rate only hedgers, which might bias the results
        against the a priori expectations. However, it might also be due to a country
        specific institutional factor, that is, U.K. firms face higher expected costs
        of financial distress due to differences in the bankruptcy codes in the two
        countries.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:55:31 UTC</pubDate></item><item><title>Australian
        On-Market Buy-Backs: An Examination of Valuation Issues</title><link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625034</link><description>A
        compelling reason for engaging in on-market buy-backs is that it provides
        a signal about the undervaluation of the company. In this paper an alternative,
        accounting based, method of determining fundamental value and undervaluation
        is used, namely the Ohlson residual income valuation framework. It is found
        that prior to the announcement buy-back companies are significantly undervalued
        relative to comparable non-buy-back companies. This undervaluation is largely
        but not totally removed in the period immediately following the on-market
        buy-back implying on-market buy-backs are predominantly an effective signaling
        mechanism. Where the firm cites undervaluation as a specific motive for the
        buy-back then, in fact, a higher degree of undervaluation prior to the buy-back
        is evident.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:56:33 UTC</pubDate></item></channel></rss>'}
