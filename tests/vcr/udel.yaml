        sector</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Agriculture contains a vast array of
        economic activities to produce and provide food, fiber&#13;\nand related products
        and services. These economic activities can be divided into three sectors:&#13;\nthe
        farm sector, agribusiness and the public sector. Using data from the 1982
        and 1997 Censuses&#13;\nof Agriculture, this bulletin documents changes in
        the farm sector of Delaware agriculture over&#13;\nthe 1982 - 1997 time period.
        It is an update to the Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin&#13;\n#503,
        The Farm Sector of Delaware Agriculture: Trends from 1982 \u2013 1992 (Tytus,
        Hastings and&#13;\nCole, 1995).&#13;\nOverall, the analysis finds that the
        farm sector of Delaware agriculture continues to&#13;\nchange. Reasons for
        the change remain the same as they have been for several decades:&#13;\ncontinued
        population growth, emerging technologies, evolving and waning demand for&#13;\nagricultural
        products, fluctuating domestic and international markets, changing consumer&#13;\npreferences,
        economic conditions both locally and nationally, increasing environmental
        concerns&#13;\nand growing competition for critical resources, such as land
        and water. These factors have&#13;\naffected the farm sector of Delaware throughout
        the last century and will continue to influence in&#13;\ninto the 21st century.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2004-09-09</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004-09-09</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2002-09</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Article</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/86</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>FREC

        The results&#13;\nof a conjoint experiment, using a sample of 199 Delawareans,&#13;\nsuggest
        that the environmental and agricultural attributes of&#13;\npreserved land
        are most important to the residents. The conjoint&#13;\nresults also suggest

        study examines the distribution of warnings and of services to victims of
        the 1999 floods in Veracruz, Mexico and offers a criticism of vulnerability
        as the dominant paradigm guiding national and international disaster-related
        programs. It has sections on the vulnerability paradigm, the 1999 flood, and
        the methods used in the analysis. The information comes from a survey of 385
        head of households flood victims residing in three cities in the north of
        Veracruz, Poza Rica, Gutierrez Zamora, and Tecolutla. The results indicate
        that government services to the population threatened by the floods were almost
        nonexistent. Radio programming and personal relations with friends, neighbors,
        and kin, were the most important sources of warnings about the hazard. The
        respondents\u2019 integration in their communities and the social organizations
        of these communities were key determinants of their receipt of warnings and
        assistance such as vertical evacuation sheltering. Authorities should place
        much greater emphasis than they do now on facilitating the use of vertical
        evacuation and the service of radio stations providing information to communities
        at risk of extreme weather events, improving their weather and disaster-preparedness
        programming and making radios available to people in areas at risk of severe
        weather and other hazards. Disaster preparedness and mitigation need to be
        made part of their efforts in community development, encouraging the growth
        of social capital that can be used for disaster response and recovery. The
        implications of these findings for the continued use of the paradigm of vulnerability
        that provides guidelines to present-day international assistance at times
        of disasters are considered.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2004-09-28T16:40:40Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004-09-28T16:40:40Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/102</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        weather has become a very important scientific, economic, and political endeavor.
        With the development of new and enhanced technology, weather forecasting skills
        have improved significantly in the United States and internationally (NRC,
        1999 and 2003). However, weather forecasting is a probabilistic science and
        many uncertainties still remain (see NSF, 2002). Indeed, despite significant
        improvements in our ability to predict the weather in the short- and long-term,
        recent experiences with natural hazards show that we continue to confront
        important challenges regarding lead times, false alarm rates, the accuracy
        and reliability of the information that is being communicated, and our ability
        to elicit the appropriate response from the public. As lead time in issuing
        severe weather warnings to threatened populations increases with improvements
        in weather monitoring, detection, and mass communication technology, the social
        and organizational features of integrated warning systems become paramount
        as key factors in saving lives and reducing damages to property. There is
        a need to continue to expand our knowledge regarding how people and organizations
        perceive and react to weather forecasts and warnings. This knowledge must
        be integrated with other technical information on weather forecasts already
        available so as to make weather information more useful to society. This paper
        explores the role of technology, the media, and interdisciplinary research
        in the communication of warnings, risk, and disaster information. We also
        focus on how researchers can communicate the importance, value, and contribution
        of hazard and disaster research to the end-user community, including emergency
        management organizations and the general public. We argue that significant
        changes need to occur in the existing scientific paradigms in order to incorporate
        the needs and problems that the end-user communities confront. Further, we
        provide a critical analysis on the importance and potential contributions
        of interdisciplinary research in the disaster field. We emphasize the need
        to develop an integrated research model to communicate risk and warnings,
        which takes into account the new and emerging technology, the role of the
        media, and the changing socio-economic and demographic characteristics of
        the general population.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2004-09-28T17:12:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004-09-28T17:12:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/105</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        goal of this study was to test a model in which the decision to evacuate is
        a function of four processes (risk perception, preparedness, social influence,
        and economic resources). Participants were interviewed by telephone both while
        they were under a hurricane warning and after the threat had disappeared (pre-post
        sample). Because all respondents had been participants in an earlier panel
        study, pre-threat data were also available. The pre-post sample of 95 panelists
        was older than the nonrespondent sample of 54 panelists who could not be reached
        by phone during the warning period but was otherwise comparable. The results
        indicated that higher risk perception and the belief that one is influenced
        by others are the strongest predictors of intentions to evacuate. Furthermore,
        risk perception was shown to mediate the influences of many background variables
        (e.g., experiences, demographics) on evacuation intentions. Post-event comparisons
        between the pre-post group and a reactivity control group of 66 panelists
        suggested that the warning period interview did not increase anxiety but may
        have influenced reactive preparedness.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2004-09-28T17:24:32Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004-09-28T17:24:32Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1998</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/107</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        natural disasters. Data were collected via two large-scale mail surveys\u2013one
        administered to Santa Cruz County, California businesses eight years after
        the Loma Prieta earthquake and one administered to businesses in South Dade
        County, Florida, six years after Hurricane Andrew. Based on the results of
        OLS regression models, we argue that long-term recovery experiences of businesses
        are affected by various firm characteristics, including the economic sector
        in which a business operates, its age and financial condition, and the scope
        of its primary market; direct and indirect disaster impacts including physical
        damage, forced closure, and disruption of operations; and owner perceptions
        of the broader economic climate. Previous disaster experience, level of disaster
        preparedness, and use of external sources of aid were not found to significantly
        affect the long-term economic viability of businesses in the two study communities.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2004-09-28T17:28:36Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004-09-28T17:28:36Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2003-02</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/108</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        the performance of the Christina School District (CSD) on the 2003&#13;\nDelaware
        State Testing Program (DSTP). The 2003 test data represent the final set of
        results&#13;\nattributable to CSD\u2019s former leadership team, which was
        replaced in July of 2003. The&#13;\nDSTP tests all public school 3rd, 5th,
        8th and 10th graders in three areas: reading, math and&#13;\nwriting. Despite
        its adequate resources, CSD has generally lagged behind most other school&#13;\ndistricts
        in Delaware in student DSTP performance. There is a persistent drop-off in
        student&#13;\nperformance between 3rd and 5th grades, due in part to a significant
        exodus of highperforming&#13;\n5th grade students to non-CSD schools, and
        there is little or no recovery in&#13;\nstudent performance levels between
        the 5th and 10th grade tests. The 2003 results identify&#13;\nschools and
        curriculum areas in particular need of improvement.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2004-09-28T19:46:15Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004-09-28T19:46:15Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004-01</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/113</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Staff

        this project, a predictive time model was developed for an Anglia Autoflow
        mechanical&#13;\nchicken catching system. At the completion of poultry growout,
        hand labor is currently used to&#13;\ncollect the birds from the house, although
        some integrators are beginning to incorporate&#13;\nmechanical catching equipment.
        Several regression models were investigated with the objective&#13;\nof predicting
        the time taken to catch the chicken. A regression model relating distance
        to total&#13;\ntime (sum of packing time, catching time, movement to catching
        and movement to packing)&#13;\nprovided the best performance. The model was
        based on data collected from poultry farms on the&#13;\nDelmarva Peninsula
        during a six-month period. Statistical Analysis System (SAS) and&#13;\nNeuroShell
        Easy Predictor were used to build the regression and neural network models&#13;\nrespectively.
        Model adequacy was established by both visual inspection and statistical&#13;\ntechniques.
        The models were validated with experimental results not incorporated into
        the initial&#13;\nmodel.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2004-09-28T19:55:26Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004-09-28T19:55:26Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2003-10</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/114</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Staff

        were used to represent soil type and the presence of broiler production at

        paper discusses what is important in preparing for and managing disaster occasions.
        The starting point is that what is crucial is not planning or managing per
        se since there is always a degree of both, but good planning and managing.
        It is possible to have bad instances of both. Thus, to assess in any intelligent
        way the preparedness planning for and the managing of disasters requires asking
        the question: What is good planning and managing? We answer this question
        on the basis of the results of the empirical research undertaken by social
        and behavioral scientists over what is now a 40 year period. This research
        cuts across natural and technological disasters and since it essentially shows
        that no significant behavioral differences in the two types of crises, we
        do not discuss any distinction in the two occasions. First, we discuss rather
        extensively ten general principles of good disaster planning. Our basic point
        is that any planning can be evaluated as being good or bad depending on how
        well it meets the ten criteria discussed. Such an evaluation can be made even
        prior to any disaster occasion. This discussion is followed with a presentation
        of ten general principles of disaster managing. This is done because our view
        is that an evaluation of the management of a disaster has to use somewhat
        different criteria than those applied to preparedness planning. Good management
        does not automatically follow even from good planning since there is only
        a partial correlation between the two processes.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2004-10-14T13:46:37Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004-10-14T13:46:37Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1997</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/136</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        disaster</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>social disruption</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Concepts
        are most useful when their formulation leads to researchable questions. For
        social scientists, the concept of disaster need to be rooted in some social
        unit--the choice here is the community, a universal form of social life and
        response. Since disasters are normativelydefined and are manifest by extraordinary
        effort on the part of community members, the mostaccurate indicators of disaster
        effects is found in the action and adaptation of communityorganizations. Two
        major community categories are identified--autonomous and dependent- while
        two noncommunity types--sector and noninstitutionalized--are also suggested.
        These different categories lead to different research leads. In any case,
        disaster as social disruption has to be viewed in a social system context.
        Disasters create many difficulties, even for social scientists. Social scientists
        have to dealwith concepts that also have popular meaning and some of those
        meanings can carry with themhigh emotional content. When events invoke moral
        and emotional reactions, conceptual discussions about them can often evoke
        charges of moral insensitivity and professional arrogance.Too, interest in
        disasters cuts across disciplinary lines so one's own interest is given highestpriority
        while the interests of others is considered marginal or perhaps even trivial.
        Given those difficulties, it is often prudent to ignore or at least to downplay
        conceptual discussions.&#13;\nPeriodically, however, it can be important to
        raise such issues. One should, however, in the discussion about disaster,
        disclaim responsibility to catalogue every sin, every trauma, all evil thatis
        intertwined with human history. There is a more delimited mandate to be explored
        here.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2004-10-14T14:01:16Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004-10-14T14:01:16Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1997</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/137</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        will contribute further to environmental degradation and hinder developmental
        programs. The industrialization and urbanization processes, however positive
        in effects along some lines, will both increase the number of potential disaster
        agents and enlarge the vulnerabilities of communities and populations at risk.
        Making for an increase are: (1) the accelerating expansion of accidents and
        mishaps in the chemical and nuclear areas; (2) technological advances that
        reduce some hazards but make some old threats more dangerous; (3) new versions
        of old and past dangers such as urban droughts; (4) the emergence of innovative
        kinds of technologies such as computers and biogenetics that present distinctively
        new dangers; and, (5) an increase in multiple (e.g., natural disasters creating
        technological ones) or synergistic type disasters resulting in more severe
        environmental consequences. Increasing the vulnerabilities are that: (1) both
        natural and technological disaster agents will have more built-up areas to
        impact; (2) more vulnerable kinds of populations will be affected than in
        the past; (3) metropolitan areas will be increasingly impacted and along certain
        lines the social organizations and group configurations of urban areas are
        not particularly well suited for coping with disasters; (4) increasing localities
        will have disastrous conditions from sources that may be quite distant and
        even from the past; and (5) certain future disasters have catastrophic potential
        although they may produce neither casualties nor do much property damage.
        There are some countervailing trends. Among the two most important are first,
        the increasing role of the mass media in calling attention to disasters; the
        second is the increasing activism of citizens in matters of public policy,
        including environmentally related issue. Nevertheless, they cannot match the
        effects of industrialization and urbanization that will almost make certain
        we will have both quantitatively more and qualitatively worse disasters in
        coming decades. However, policies can be established and steps can be taken
        that will reduce and weaken some of the negative effects of the probable catastrophic
        disasters of the future. Among major ones are: (1) noting and accepting the
        fact that all disasters are essentially social occasions that initially and
        primarily have to be dealt with by social means; (2) dropping the distinction
        in planning between natural and technological disasters and moving to an all
        hazard or generic approach; (3) making disaster mitigation at least as much
        a priority in planning and application as emergency preparedness, response
        and recovery; (4) more closely integrating disaster planning to the developmental
        planning or social change processes of the social system involved; and (5)
        ascertaining in what ways disaster problems are similar to and different from
        other environmental problems, and concurrently addressing both where there
        are similarities. If the right policies and measures are put in place, the
        future will not be the past revisited nor will it be only the present repeated.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2004-12-13T22:46:07Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004-12-13T22:46:07Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1997</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/199</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Using standard tools of potential theory, we find that these radial functions
        are susceptible to the Runge phenomenon, not only in the limit of increasingly
        flat functions, but also in the finite shape parameter case. We show that
        there exist interpolation node distributions that prevent such phenomena and
        allow stable approximations. Using polynomials also provides an explicit interpolation
        formula that avoids the difficulties of inverting interpolation matrices,
        without imposing restrictions on the shape parameter or number of points.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2004-12-21T16:37:10Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004-12-21T16:37:10Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        reactionary systems. As such, it is necessary to understand the manner in
        which these processes develop and the role that they play in a given system.
        Vascular blood flow is characterized by convective, diffusive, and reactive
        processes. Specifically, blood clot formation involves platelet convection
        within the blood stream, diffusion through the L\xE9v\xEAque boundary layer
        of the blood vessel, and binding to vascular breaches. Accordingly, in order
        to understand blood clotting, the fluid mechanics of blood flow as well as
        the reaction mechanism of platelet adhesion are relevant. In this study, we
        formulate a mathematical model for blood clotting and associated processes.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2004-12-21T21:37:04Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004-12-21T21:37:04Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004-09-01</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        mathematical modeling and analysis of electrostatically actuated micro- and
        nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS) has typically relied upon simplified
        electrostatic field approximations to facilitate the analysis. Usually, the
        small aspect ratio of typical MEMS and NEMS devices is used to simplify Laplace's
        equation. Terms small in this aspect ratio are ignored. Unfortunately, such
        an approximation is not uniformly valid in the spatial variables. Here, this
        approximation is revisited and a uniformly valid asymptotic theory for a general
        \"drum shaped\" electrostatically actuated device is presented. The structure
        of the solution set for the standard non-uniformly valid theory is reviewed
        and new numerical results for several domain shapes presented. The effect

        boundary integral equations. Their numerical discretizations are known as
        the boundary element methods. This paper gives an overview of the method from
        both theoretical and numerical point of view. It summaries the main results

        theory and various applications will be illustrated through simple examples.
        Some numerical experiments in elasticity as well as in fluid mechanics will

        by a series of recent articles in which the validity of the AGM relation and
        the domain of convergence of the continued fraction were determined for certain
        complex parameters [4, 3, 2]. A study of the AGM continued fraction is equivalent
        to an analysis of the convergence of certain difference equations and the

        algorithm (FBP) is a standard image reconstruction algorithm used in many
        imaging modalities. The FBP algorithm is suited for high-frequency imaging
        applications, that is, applications where the specimen is much larger than
        the wavelengths of the incident fields. However, when data is scarce due to
        limited view or dosage considerations, or when super-resolution is required,
        different techniques are needed to adequately resolve the specimen. We present
        a generalization of the filtered backprojection algorithm that extends the
        capabilities of acoustic imaging systems to limited aperture and wavelength
        resolution. Our principal interest is applications to acoustic (scalar) scattering,
        though the methodology we develop can be extended to general electromagnetic
        (vector) settings.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2004-12-22T03:00:39Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004-12-22T03:00:39Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        atomicscale resolution</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>In recent years, improvements
        in electromagnetic sources, detectors, optical components, and computational
        imaging have made it possible to achieve three-dimensional atomicscale resolution
        using tomographic phase-contrast imaging techniques. These greater capabilities
        have placed a premium on improving the efficiency and stability of phase retrieval
        algorithms for recovering the missing phase information in diffraction observations.
        In some cases, . so called direct methods suffice, but for large macromolecules
        and nonperiodic structures one must rely on numerical techniques for reconstructing
        the missing phase. This is the principal motivation of our work. We report
        on recent progress in algorithms for iterative phase retrieval. The theory
        of convex optimisation is used to develop and to gain insight into counterparts
        for the .nonconvex problem of phase retrieval. We propose a relaxation of
        averaged alternating reflectors and determine the fundamental mathematical
        properties of the related operator in the convex case. Numerical studies support
        our theoretical observations and demonstrate the effectiveness of the newer
        generation of algorithms compared to the current state of the art.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2004-12-22T03:07:41Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004-12-22T03:07:41Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        stage over the last three decades. As a result,&#13;\nwhat the media chose
        to cover and how they chose to cover it is an&#13;\nimportant question. That
        is magnified when the media turn their attention to a public&#13;\npolicy
        issue like the death penalty that already possesses profound social significance.&#13;\nIn
        no other area of public policy can the state impose its will so completely
        and finally&#13;\non an individual citizen. Therefore, the public should understand
        the issues that&#13;\nsurround capital punishment. That understanding is virtually
        always communicated&#13;\nthrough media organizations because very few of
        us have first-hand knowledge of the&#13;\ndeath penalty. In this paper, I
        explore how television broadcast organizations cover&#13;\nthe imposition

        best-known negative answer to Mark Kac's question, \"Can one hear the shape
        of a drum?\" is a pair of octagons discovered by Gordon, Webb, and Wolpert.
        Their nonconstructive proof of Dirichlet isospectrality has since been supplemented
        by experiment and high-accuracy computation of many of the eigenvalues of
        these drums. In this paper we compute the Neumann modes of these regions,
        also known to be identical, to high precision. Additionally, we carry out
        the computations for two cases in which the boundary conditions alternate
        between Dirichlet and Neumann around the sides. There is overwhelming numerical
        evidence that the regions remain isospectral, though to our knowledge there
        has been no analytic demonstration of this fact.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-01-28T20:48:37Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-01-28T20:48:37Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2003</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        L.</dc:creator>\n<dc:subject>disaster recovery</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>We
        discuss four general topics. First, there are various referents for the term
        \"recovery.\" We note that what seems a simple enough term or word, namely
        \"recovery\" covers a variety of very complex activities that need to be addressed
        in any practical and/or theoretical discussion about the issue. What a process
        is called, can make a significant difference in consequences. Second, we consider
        the policy implications of what might constitute success or failure in disaster
        recovery. These are related to the goals and levels of recovery, the size
        of the recovering unit, different perspectives on the process, the secondary
        or ripple effects of disasters on recovery, and differences in recovery in
        disasters compared to catastrophes. Third, we highlight and summarize ten
        general themes from the research literature about what is known about those
        individuals and households who are assisted in the recovery effort after disasters.
        There are substantial differences regarding, for instance, the sources of
        aid, the kinds of help provided, and the effects of the assistance given to
        victims in the recovery process. Fourth, we discuss what the research literature
        says about those who give or provide disaster assistance to individuals and
        households in the aftermath of a disaster. The givers or providers, usually
        organizations, have more complex problems than usually is recognized.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-03T16:58:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-03T16:58:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1998</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/282</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        past few years have seen impressive growth in our ability to think about earthquakes,
        their causes, and their consequences in holistic terms.  Reducing earthquake
        losses is no longer the province of a small set of specialized disciplines;
        rather, both research and practice increasingly emphasize the need to approach
        the problem of earthquakes and their impacts from a multi-disciplinary and
        interdisciplinary perspective.  Perhaps the most striking recent change is
        a growing appreciation for the role the social science disciplines play in
        characterizing and managing the earthquake threat.  More than ever before,
        researchers and practitioners in the fields of engineering, the earth sciences,
        and other disciplines concerned with the earthquake problem are working collaboratively
        on research  with social scientists and asking their advice on policies, programs,
        and loss-reduction strategies.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-03T17:19:33Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-03T17:19:33Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1998</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/283</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        paper for the International Seminar on the Quality of Life and Environmental
        Risks held in Rio di Janeiro, Brazil, October 10-11, 1996.  It is a slightly
        revised version of Disaster Research Center Preliminary Paper # 199 which
        was the expanded written version of the oral remarks made at the 2nd National
        Congress of Universities on Civil Protection held at the University of Colima
        in Colima City, Mexico on June 27-29, 1994.  Some of the material also appeared
        in earlier publications (Quarantelli 1988; 1991; 1992; 1993; 1994).  There
        are plans in Brazil to publish this paper in Portuguese in 1999.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The
        paper discusses what is important in preparing for and managing disaster occasions.
        \ The starting point is that what is crucial is not planning or managing per
        se since there is always a degree of both, but good planning and managing.
        \ It is after all possible to have bad instances of both.  Thus, to assess
        in any intelligent way the preparedness planning for and the managing of disasters
        requires asking the question: What is good planning and managing?&#13;\n&#13;\nWe
        attempt to answer this question on the basis of the results of the empirical
        research undertaken by social and behavioral scientists over what is now a
        40 year period.  This research cuts across natural and technological disasters
        and since it essentially shows that no significant behavioral differences
        in the two types of crises, we do not discuss any distinction in the two occasions.&#13;\n&#13;\nFirst,
        we discuss rather extensively ten general principles of good disaster planning.
        \ Our basic point is that any planning can be evaluated as being good or bad
        depending on how well it meets the ten criteria discussed.  Such an evaluation
        can be made even prior to any disaster occasion.&#13;\n&#13;\nThis discussion
        is followed with a presentation of ten general principles of disaster managing.
        \ This is done because our view is that an evaluation of the management of
        a disaster has to use somewhat different criteria than those applied to preparedness
        planning.  Good management does not automatically follow even from good planning
        since there is only a partial correlation between the two processes.&#13;\n&#13;\nThe
        paper concludes with noting that the greater part of the research studies
        we used has been done in developed countries rather than developing ones.
        \ Thus, we first discuss some possible disaster-related differences between
        the two kinds of social systems.  Our general conclusion is that the 20 principles
        derived mostly from studies in developed societies are in varying degrees
        applicable to developing countries.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-03T19:44:40Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-03T19:44:40Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1998</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/286</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Strategies</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Nigg, Joanne M.</dc:creator>\n<dc:subject>Earthquake-General</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>The
        effectiveness of earthquake prediction as a tool for reducing earthquake impacts
        depends, in part, on developing community response plans that can be implemented
        when predictions are issued.  The overarching policy issue--how to lessen
        earthquake losses to the built environment and social systems by disseminating
        forewarnings of future damaging earthquake events--has continued to be the
        focus of governmental efforts to deal with scientific forecasts (e.g., FEMA
        1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1995) but the specific strategies considered
        have varied, often due to changes in scientific approaches to prediction.
        \ &#13;\n\tThis case study will trace the interwoven strands of scientific
        approaches and policy responses to earthquake predictions during the past
        25 years, beginning in the early 1970s until today.  The State of California
        has been the focus for concentrated research--in both earth science and social
        science--on earthquake prediction during this period; however, federal policy
        has had an important role in identifying priorities for both scientists and
        state and local government officials with respect to the manner in which earthquake
        predictions would impact upon society.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-03T20:06:23Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-03T20:06:23Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1998</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/288</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        all of what is known about overall disaster related social behavior.  Drawing
        from a base of 50 years of social science research involving thousands of
        studies, we note the typical patterns of behavior at the individual, organizational,
        community and mass media levels.  The last is a surrogate for reactions at
        the societal level.  To avoid interminable and specific documentation, readers
        are presented a large bibliography at the end of this paper that lists the
        major research literature examined for the purpose of this essay.  Most disasters
        impact a community.  However, there are non-community types of disasters,
        e.g., a plane crash in an isolated rural area.  This affects behavioral responses
        (e.g., crash survivors do not receive the social support that emerges in a
        community when residents have undergone a common disaster experience).  The
        20 general observations below around which we organize our comments, are mostly
        about community disasters. &#13;\n&#13;\nThis is the paper written as background
        for the oral remarks to be made at the 8Th International Symposium on Natural
        and Technological Hazards: Hazards 2000 to be held in Tokushima, Shikoku,

        it is necessary to point out that social organization is capable of enduring
        significant shocks contrary to the usual prediction that such shock lead to
        the end of civilization.  Consequently, it is useful to talk about cases of
        significant threats to the social order of a magnitude beyond 9/11.  Second,
        the question will be raised as to how conceptually we can deal with order/disorder
        and organization/disorganization.  Third, I want to examine some of the unanticipated
        consequences in American society as a result of 9/11, consequences which are
        little noticed but might be significant and costly in the future.  &#13;\nInvited

        Account</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>The timing of the Lisbon earthquake
        made it a topic of discussion and disputation among intellectuals involved
        in what has come to be known as the Enlightenment.  In part, it challenged
        growing liberal views about the miracles and wonder of nature itself.  And
        it seemed to reaffirm the presence of God that many were trying to make abstract,
        distant and benign.  The interest here, however, is that the earthquake on
        November 1, 1755 can be considered the first \u201Cmodern\u201D disaster because
        it was first to evoke a coordinated state emergency response as well as a
        forward looking comprehensive effort for reconstruction which included mitigation
        efforts to reduce future disaster efforts.&#13;\n\tMajor earthquakes were
        not new.  There had been a major earthquake in Port Royal, Jamaica in 1693
        and in Catania, Sicily and in Naples in 1693.  But most of Northern Europe
        was seismically stable and for most Europeans, earthquakes occurred elsewhere.
        \ Lisbon was not the first to evoke governmental interest.  At times, European
        governments have been involved in the process of reconstructing colonial towns
        and villages destroyed by earthquakes.   But when the Lisbon earthquake occurred,
        it became the focus of attention for the \u201Crelevant civilized world\u201D.&#13;\n&#13;\nRevised

        Volunteerism In A Consensus Crisis:  Mass Media Coverage Of Volunteers In

        Media</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Social Factors</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>On
        September 11, 2001, the world witnessed one of the most hideous terrorist
        attacks ever perpetrated on American soil. Individuals from the Al Qaeda terrorist
        network intentionally flew commercial jetliners into the World Trade Center
        in New York City and the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, leaving the highest
        death toll (near three thousand people) ever registered for a single terrorist
        act. Beyond comparison in terms of its nature and magnitude, the tragedy generated
        both a vast disruption and the mobilization of many individuals, organizations,
        and resources.  &#13;\nThis paper examines the mass media coverage of volunteerism
        in the context of the World Trade Center disaster. Using news accounts, this
        paper, firstly, explores the extent of convergence in Lower Manhattan immediately
        after the terrorist attacks and the types of activities in which volunteers
        engaged. Then, using notions of \u201Cframe analysis\u201D advanced by social
        scientists such as Goffman (1974) and Gamson (1985), this paper seeks to identify
        how the media \u201Cframed\u201D volunteerism in the context of 9/11. The
        mass media both empowers and limits understanding by providing an edited or
        fragmented version of reality. Thus, it is crucial to identify both what frames
        the media borrowed from broader cultural contexts and what frames the media
        made available to the public when reporting volunteerism in 9/11.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-08T13:31:43Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-08T13:31:43Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2003</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/296</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Half Century Of Social Science Disaster Research:Selected Major Findings And
        Their Applicability</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Quarantelli, E. L.</dc:creator>\n<dc:subject>Disaster
        Research</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Since systematic studies started in
        the early 1950s, there has now been a half century of social science disaster
        research.  After all this work, what can be said about what is known about
        the human and social behavior associated with natural and technological disasters?
        \ This paper highlights some of the more major findings from these studies.
        \ No attempt is made to present all that has been established by the research;
        that would require writing an encyclopedia.  Our goal here is more limited
        and selective. Drawing from this base of 50+ years of social science research
        involving thousands of studies, we note some of the more established and important
        patterns of behavior at the individual, organizational, community and societal
        levels.  However, we will not discuss the societal level directly because
        there is limited  knowledge about that level.  Instead we will discuss mass
        communication systems (in some respects seeing them as surrogates for society).
        \ At the end of all the substantive observations we will make some comments
        on what has been done with this established knowledge, or in other words,
        how the research findings have been  applied.  To avoid interminable and specific
        documentation, readers are presented a large bibliography at the end of this
        paper that lists the major research literature examined for the purpose of
        this paper.  &#13;\n&#13;\nTo what extent are the research-based observations
        we discuss applicable everywhere? This is a very legitimate question. It is
        of particular relevance given that most of the studies so far undertaken have
        been done by social scientists in Western type societies, even though the
        great majority of disasters occur in developing countries.  The observations
        from the ever growing number of studies in non-Western social systems appears
        to be consistent with what we have reported in this paper.  But more will
        have to be done before we can be sure that the observations are universal
        ones.  Even if that turns out to be the case, it is also to be expected that
        there will be societal- and cultural-specific human and group behaviors that
        might require some qualifications on the general observations made so far.
        \ There are some indications that the more universal behaviors are at the
        individual level, with increasingly fewer universal ones as the analysis goes
        from organizations to communities to societies. &#13;\n&#13;\nWe start with
        a discussion about community disasters.  The great majority of disasters impact
        a community.  However, there are non-community types of disasters, e.g., a
        plane crash in an isolated rural area. This affects behavioral responses (e.g.,
        \ crash survivors do not receive the social support that emerges in a community
        when residents have undergone a common disaster experience).  The 20 general
        observations below around which we organize our comments, are mostly about
        community disasters. &#13;\n&#13;\nThis is the paper written as background
        for the oral remarks made at the Hazards 2002 Conference in Antalya, Turkey,
        Oct. 3, 2002.  This is also somewhat of an updated version of the material
        presented in Disaster Research Center Preliminary Paper #280.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-08T13:42:26Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-08T13:42:26Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2003</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/297</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Disaster Research Center (DRC) at the University of Delaware, with the financial
        support of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the College of Arts and
        Sciences, held a two-day conference titled \u201CDisaster Research in the
        Social Sciences: Lessons Learned, Challenges, and Future Trajectories.\u201D
        The conference highlighted the interdisciplinary and international nature
        of the disaster research field and focused on: 1) the growth and development
        of the field of disasters, from the perspective of the Social Sciences; 2)
        theoretical, methodological, and public policy contributions of the field;
        3) lessons learned and best practices that have emerged from this area of
        research; and 4) future trajectories or opportunities for Social Science research
        in the study of disasters. &#13;\n&#13;\n\tConference participants included
        leading scholars and researchers, practitioners, representatives from funding
        organizations, and graduate and undergraduate students. The conference allowed
        participants to discuss substantive, theoretical, and methodological issues
        and concerns relevant to the field as well as to generate new research initiatives
        that will contribute to our understanding and knowledge regarding the study
        of disasters. Substantive and critical issues discussed during this two-day
        conference included: the growth and development of disaster research in the
        Social Sciences; theoretical and methodological contributions and challenges
        in disaster research; impact of disaster research for practitioners; the role
        and importance of multi- and inter-disciplinary research in the disaster field;
        the development of an international research agenda; the role of research
        centers in training the new generation of researchers; funding disaster research
        and priorities for the future in a post-9/11 environment; major research areas
        and issues that need to be developed and explored over the next decade at
        both the national and international level; and efforts to establish collaborative
        research initiatives across disciplines and geographical boundaries.&#13;\n\tDRC
        was the first Social Science research center in the world devoted to the study
        of disasters, so it was appropriate and timely that a conference of such magnitude
        was held at the University of Delaware at a particularly historical moment
        for the DRC and the field of disaster studies. This conference not only provided
        a stimulating intellectual environment but it also presented an opportunity
        to celebrate DRC\u2019s 40th anniversary and to examine the impact and contributions
        of the Center to the field of disaster research both nationally and internationally.
        Moreover, during the two-day event, conference participants had an opportunity
        to pay tribute to Enrico L. Quarantelli and Russell R. Dynes, two of the founding
        fathers of DRC and disaster research from a social science perspective.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-08T14:04:58Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-08T14:04:58Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/298</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        term \"panic\" is widely used in everyday speech as well as in the literature
        of different professional areas and scientific disciplines.  This article
        confines itself primarily to discussing how sociologists, historically and
        currently, view the phenomena.  The justification for such a focus is that
        the concept has long been used in the discipline especially in the sociological
        subspeciality of collective behavior, and much of the relevant empirical work
        has been done by sociologists studying behavior in natural and technological
        disasters.&#13;\n&#13;\nEarly approaches to panic were vague in defining the
        phenomena.  However, most formulations view panic as either extreme and groundless
        fear, or flight behavior.  Both phenomena are supposedly widespread in crisis
        situations.  Present day discussions about panic also revolve around whether
        or not the behavior is irrational, and whether it is highly contagious or
        not.  Three major empirical studies that have heavily influenced present day
        sociological views about panic are presented.  Two of the studies particularly
        challenge widespread ideas in the literature about the phenomena, showing
        for example that panic flight  is very rare, and has few of the characteristics
        typically attributed to the behavior, even in situations where it might be
        expected.&#13;\n&#13;\nThere are two questions that will loom even larger
        in the future.  One is why despite the research evidence, the idea of \"panic\"
        captures the popular imagination and continues to be evoked by scholars of
        human behavior.  A second basic question is whether there is still any scientific
        justification for the continuing use of the concept in any technical sense
        in the collective behavior area.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-14T20:26:56Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-14T20:26:56Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2001</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/308</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Disaster Recovery Process:  What We Know And Do Not Know From Research</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Quarantelli,
        E. L.</dc:creator>\n<dc:subject>Disaster Recovery</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Research</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>This
        is the written paper prepared as background for the oral remarks made at the
        International Forum on Civil Protection on March 20, 1999 at Foligno, Italy.
        \ It is an updating of an earlier version (Quarantelli, 1998).</dc:description>\n<dc:description>We
        discuss five general topics.&#13;\n&#13;\nFirst, there are various referents
        for the term \"recovery.\"  We note that what seems a simple enough term or
        word, namely \"recovery\" covers a variety of very complex activities that
        need to be addressed in any practical and/or theoretical discussion about
        the issue.  What a process is called, can make a significant difference in
        consequences.&#13;\n&#13;\nSecond, we consider the policy implications of
        what might constitute success or failure in disaster recovery.  These are
        related to the goals and levels of recovery, the size of the recovering unit,
        different perspectives on the process, the secondary or ripple effects of
        disasters on recovery, and differences in recovery in disasters compared to
        catastrophes.&#13;\n&#13;\nThird, we highlight and summarize ten general themes
        from the research literature about what is known about those individuals and
        households who are assisted in the recovery effort after disasters.  There
        are substantial differences regarding, for instance, the sources of aid, the
        kinds of help provided, and the effects of the assistance given to victims
        in the recovery process.&#13;\n&#13;\nFourth, we discuss what the research
        literature says about those who give or provide disaster assistance to individuals
        and households in the aftermath of a disaster.  The givers or providers, usually
        organizations, have more complex problems than usually is recognized.&#13;\n&#13;\nFifth,
        we note two poorly studied questions.  How do different cultural values affect
        the process (as illustrated by corruption)?  What role do political considerations
        play in the process?  These and other factors suggest some of the limits of
        the observations we have drawn from the existing research base.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-14T20:48:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-14T20:48:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1999</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/309</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        are at a period of time in history when massive social changes are sweeping
        the world.  Some of the most basic institutions and social arrangements are
        being basically transformed.  An example is the major change occurring in
        the role and status of women, compared with the position they have had for
        centuries.  This social trend along with others, such as the change almost
        everywhere to a market type economy, will indirectly affect the nature and
        quality of future disasters as well as how they can be planned for and managed.
        \  &#13;\n&#13;\nHowever, given the focus of this Forum, we want to highlight
        three other social trends that will directly impact preparing for and responding
        to natural and technological disasters.  They are:&#13;\n&#13;\n1.  The large
        scale development of civil protection or disaster management;\t&#13;\n&#13;\n2.
        The computer-based information/knowledge revolution and its effect on that
        development; and,&#13;\n&#13;\n3.  The changing role of higher education also
        in that development. &#13;\n&#13;\nThis is the written version of the paper
        presented at the Conference on The Protection of Cultural Heritage held at

        dependence of thermodynamic properties of planar interphase boundaries (IPBs)
        and antiphase boundaries (APBs) in a binary alloy on an FCC lattice is studied
        as a function of their orientation.  Using a recently-developed diffuse interface
        model based on three non-conserved order parameters and the concentration,
        and a free energy density that gives a realistic phase diagram with one disordered
        phase (A1) and two ordered phases (L12 and L10) such as occurs in the Cu-Au
        system, we are able to find IPBs and APBs between any pair of phases and domains,
        and for all orientations.  The model includes bulk and gradient terms in a
        free energy functional, and assumes that there is no mismatch in the lattice
        parameters for the disordered and ordered phases.  We catalog the appropriate
        boundary conditions for all IPBs and APBs.  We then focus on the IPB between
        the disordered A1 phase and the L10 ordered phase.  For this IPB we compute
        the numerical solution of the boundary value problem to find the interfacial
        energy, \u03B3, as a function of orientation, temperature, and chemical potential
        (or composition).  We determine the equilibrium shape for a precipitate of
        one phase within the other using the Cahn-Hoffman \u2018\u03BE-vector\u2019
        formalism.  We find that the profile of the interface is determined only by
        one conserved and one non-conserved order parameter, which leads to a surface
        energy which, as a function of orientation, is \u201Ctransversely isotropic\u201D
        with respect to the tetragonal axis of the L10 phase.  We verify the model\u2019s
        consistency with the Gibbs adsorption equation.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-16T17:41:24Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-16T17:41:24Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2003</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        comparison of two Lagrangian&#13;\nmethods for solutions to the two-dimensional,
        incompressible convection-diffusion equations. The&#13;\nfirst Lagrangian
        method is an axisymmetric core spreading method using Gaussian basis functions.&#13;\nThe
        second method uses deforming elliptical Gaussian basis functions. Previous
        results show that&#13;\nthe first method has second-order spatial accuracy
        and the second method has fourth-order spatial&#13;\naccuracy. However, the
        deforming basis functions require more computational effort per element,&#13;\nso
        this paper examines computational performance as well as overall accuracy.
        The test problem is&#13;\nthe deformation and diffusion of ellipsoidal distribution
        of scalar with an underlying flow field that&#13;\nhas closed circular streamlines.
        The test suite includes moderate, high and infinite Peclet number&#13;\nproblems.
        The results indicate that the performance tradeoff for the sample flow calculation
        occur&#13;\nat modest problem sizes, and that the fourth-order method offers
        distinct advantages as a general&#13;\napproach for challenging problems.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-16T19:17:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-16T19:17:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2003</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        tractable single-factor models have been devised for the well-known Bond Pricing
        Equation (BPE). In this paper, new tractable models are formulated in a systematic
        manner. First, the BPE is transformed to a standard canonical form in which
        only one coefficient function appears. In some interesting cases, this single
        coefficient function is identically zero, leaving nothing more to solve than
        the classical heat equation. In many cases, the canonical form allows a general
        solution by standard mathematical techniques such as separation of variables
        and Laplace transforms. In other cases, the general solution of the BPE is
        reduced to a single inverse Laplace Transform.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-16T19:45:39Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-16T19:45:39Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2003</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        for solving the inverse scattering&#13;\nproblem for acoustic and electromagnetic
        waves. There are two versions of&#13;\nthe linear sampling method. Although
        the second version is on a firm mathematical&#13;\nfoundation, it is restricted
        to the case of non-absorbing media, full&#13;\naperture scattering data or,
        more specifically, to the cases when the far field&#13;\noperator is normal.
        The first version of the linear sampling method is more&#13;\nflexible, being
        able to treat the aforementioned cases as well as partially coated&#13;\nobstacles.
        However, its mathematical foundation is less well established. In&#13;\nthis

        device used to measure rate constants is the IAsys, and the flow in such a
        device can be modeled as stagnation point flow. Due to the special nature
        of the flow, the effects of transport on a surface reaction near a stagnation
        point may be incorporated exactly as long as the initial concentration of
        bound state is uniform. However, if the bound state is nonuniform initially,
        a complicated integrodifferential equation arises for the evolution of the
        bound state. Such a form is inconvenient for data analysis. The averaged approximation
        replaces the nonuniform initial state with its average, thus simplifying the
        analysis. This approximation is correct to O(Da) as the Damk\xF6hler number
        Da \u2014&gt; 0. A numerical simulation of the integrodifferential equation
        is performed which shows that the averaged approximation is useful even outside
        this regime.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-16T20:18:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-16T20:18:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2002</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        design of repository seals for deeply buried high-level radioactive wastes&#13;\nincorporates
        densely compacted clayey barriers around metallic waste canisters. In this
        paper, a&#13;\nmathematical model that is based on conservation of thermal
        energy and mass is developed to&#13;\ndescribe the locations of moisture and
        temperature fronts within a barrier, around a cylindrical&#13;\nwaste canister
        of 1-meter radius, containing radionuclides with half-lives that range from
        100 \u2013&#13;\n10,000 years. The solution developed is axisymmetric: the
        moisture fraction, w, and temperature&#13;\nT, vary only with time t, and
        radial distance r from the axis of the cylindrical waste canister. The&#13;\nmodel
        produces parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). The spatial domain
        is discretized&#13;\nsuch that ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that
        result are solved. Computations using a&#13;\nuniform mesh of 0.1 meters and
        a cooling coefficient of 6.7 x 10 -2 with assumed but typical data&#13;\non
        material properties, indicate that coupling of transport processes would be
        negligible in the&#13;\ncase of radionuclides with long half-lives. Also,
        a quasi-steady vaporization front can form and&#13;\npropagate outward over
        the course of several decades after waste emplacement. The evolution of&#13;\nthe
        front is somewhat insensitive to the half-life used and the permeability of
        the clayey barrier&#13;\nmaterial.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-17T17:28:39Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-17T17:28:39Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2002</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        with Isometric Mapping and Back-Projection for Conditioning Families in a
        Simple Sobolev Space</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Dallas, A.G.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>Numerically
        stable Galerkin procedures can be constructed by ensuring that the families
        of trial- and test-functions are well conditioned in the respective Hilbert
        spaces between which the operator is an (appropriate) isomorphism. We explain
        an idea for constructing a family that may be well conditioned in a given
        Sobolev space of nonzero fractional order from a family that is well conditioned
        in the corresponding zero-order space, by using a naturally occurring isometric
        operator followed by projection back onto the original subspace. Effectively,
        the construction results in \"preconditioning matrices,\" to be used in transforming
        the original Galerkin matrix to produce new ones which may be of much smaller
        condition number. The underlying geometric setting must be sufficiently simple,
        so that the Sobolev structures can me \"manipulated numerically.\" While we
        have not yet proven the well-conditioning of the constructed families, the
        use of the scheme is illustrated numerically in applications to the approximate
        solution of a first-kind integral equation arising in two-dimensional acoustic
        scattering, where a pronounced stabilizing effect is observed.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-17T18:20:17Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-17T18:20:17Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2001</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        a Boundary-Integral Equation in Three Dimensions as as Integral-Operator Problem
        in a Plane Region</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Dallas, A.G.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>Motivated
        by a desire to simplify the design of numerically stable and efficient approximation
        schemes for boundary-operator problems, we develop a framework in which an
        integral equation on the boundary of a domain ${I\\kern-.30em R}^3$ can be
        systematically reformulated as an integral-operator problem set in a region
        in the plane; some geometric restrictions are imposed on the shape of the
        (smooth) boundary. When the plane region is chosen to be a rectangle, the
        necessary Sobolev-space structures can be handled numerically rather easily
        in the new simpler geometry, in contrast to the situation on the original
        boundary. Moreover, familiar trial- and test- functions can then be employed
        in the construction of approximate solutions of the reformulated problems.
        We show for two examples how a well-posed problem can be transferred from
        the domain-boundary setting to the plane-region setting. We describe a numerical
        implementation of these ideas to a lower-dimensional example involving the
        approximate solution of a first-kind integral equation associated with the
        Helmholtz equation that is originally set on the boundary of a domain in ${I\\kern-.30em
        R}^2$.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-17T18:46:38Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-17T18:46:38Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2001</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        also known as the Lamb-Oseen vortex, is the only localized, rotating, self-similar
        solution to the two-dimensional, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations where
        level sets of vorticity and corotating streamfunction coincide. Our definition
        of self-similarity is restricted to the natural linear combination of space,
        time and viscous diffusion. We arrive at this conclusion by analytically determining
        the azimuthal Fourier modes for all possible solutions to this problem and
        then proving that the amplitude of all but the first (axisymmetric) is zero.
        Since coherent vortex multipoles are observed to be in a state where lines
        of vorticity and corotating streamfunction correspond, this casts doubt on
        the existence of any self-similar asymptotic structure other than the monopole.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-17T18:56:19Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-17T18:56:19Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2001</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        method based on elliptical Gaussian basis&#13;\nfunctions. Each basis function
        translates, nutates, elongates and spreads through the action of the&#13;\nlocal
        flow field and fluid viscosity. By allowing elements to deform, the method
        captures the effects of&#13;\nlocal flow deviations with a fourth order spatial
        accuracy. This method uses a fourth order asymptotic&#13;\napproximation to
        the Biot-Savart integrals for elliptical Gaussian vorticity distributions
        to determine&#13;\nvelocity and velocity derivatives. A robust adaptive refinement
        procedure reconfigures elements that&#13;\nspread beyond the specified resolution.
        The high order convergence rate is verified by comparing&#13;\ncalculations
        with the vortex method to exact solutions in a variety of controlled experiments.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-17T20:23:10Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-17T20:23:10Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2001</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        is constructed to study the evolution of a vertically-oriented thin, free
        liquid film draining under gravity when there is an insoluble surfactant,
        with finite surface viscosity, on its free surface. Lubrication theory for
        this free film results in four coupled nonlinear partial differential equations
        (PDEs) describing the free surface shape, the surface velocities and the surfacant
        transport, at leading order. Numerical experiments are performed to understand
        the stability of the system to perturbations across the film. In the limit
        of large surface viscosities, the evolution of the free surface is that of
        a rigid film. In addition, these large surface viscosities act as stabilizing
        factors due to their energy dissipating effect. An instability is seen for
        the mobile case; this is caused by a competition between gravity and the Marangoni
        effect. The behavior observed from this model qualitatively matches some structures
        observed in draining film experiments</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-17T20:31:32Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-17T20:31:32Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2002-05-09</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        and deposition flux are the main mechanisms of the growth, and that the three
        key surface quantities (energy, mobility and adatom diffusivity) are anisotropic
        with either four- or six-fold symmetry. A geometrical approach to the motion

        surface tension and surface viscosity. The surface tension and surface viscosity
        depend nonlinearly on the surfactant concentration. Using lubrication theory
        we obtain a leading order description of the shape and velocity of the fluid-air
        interface, and the surfactant concentration, in the form of coupled nonlinear
        partial differential equations. A linear stability analysis reveals that the
        wavenumber that characterizes the marginal state is independent of the presence
        of the surfactant and the nonlinearity of the surface properties. We solve
        the 1+1-dimensional system numerically to obtain the spatio-temporal evolution
        of the free surface in the nonlinear regime, and observe the progression to
        rupture.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-18T16:11:53Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-18T16:11:53Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2001-09-12</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        problems in substructures, domain decomposition methods are well suited for
        both parallelization and coupling of different discretization&#13;\nschemes.
        In general, the coupled problem is reduced to the Schur complement equation
        on the skeleton of the domain decomposition. Boundary integral equations are&#13;\nused

        addition to traditional finite elements,&#13;\nthe Trefftz elements for which
        the governing equations of equilibrium are required to be&#13;\nsatisfied
        a priori within the subdomain elements. If the Trefftz elements are modelled&#13;\nwith
        boundary potentials supported by the individual element boundaries, this defines&#13;\nthe
        so\u2013called macro\u2013elements. These allow one to handle in particular
        situations involv-ing&#13;\nsingular features such as cracks, inclusions,
        corners and notches providing a locally&#13;\nhigh resolution of the desired
        stress fields, in combination with a traditional global varia-tional&#13;\nFEM
        analysis. The global stiffness matrix is here sparse as the one in conventional&#13;\nFEM.
        In addition, with slight modifications, the macro\u2013elements can be incorporated&#13;\ninto
        standard commercial FEM codes. The coupling between the elements is modelled&#13;\nby
        using a generalized compatibility condition in a weak sense with additional
        elements&#13;\non the skeleton. The latter allows us to relax the continuity
        requirements for the global&#13;\ndisplacement field. In particular, the mesh
        points of the macro\u2013elements can be chosen&#13;\nindependently of the
        nodes of the FEM structure. This approach permits the combination&#13;\nof
        independent meshes and also the exploitation of modern parallel computing

        of Traces and Normal Derivatives of Spherical-Separable Solutions of the Helmholtz
        Equation</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Dallas, A.G.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>The
        classical solutions of the Heimholtz equation resulting from the separation-of-variables
        procedure in spherical co\xF6rdinates are frequently used in one way or another
        to approximate other solutions. In particular, traces and/or normal derivatives
        of certain sequences of these spherical-separable solutions are commonly used
        as trial-and-test-functions in Galerkin procedures for the approximate solution
        of boundary-operator problems arising from the reformulation of exterior or
        interior boundary-value problems and set on the boundary \u0393 of the domain
        where a solution is wanted. While the completeness properties of these traces
        and normal derivatives in the usual Hilbert space L2( \u0393) are well known,
        their basis properties are not. We show that such sequences of traces or normal
        derivatives of the outgoing spherical-separable solutions form bases for L2(
        \u0393) only when \u0393 is a sphere centered at the pole of the spherical
        solutions; corresponding results are given for the entire solutions, accounting
        for the possibility of an interior eigenvalue. We identify other Hilbert spaces,
        connected with the far-field pattern, for which these functions do provide
        bases. We apply the results to discuss some aspects of the Waterman schemes
        for approximate solutions of scattering problems (the so-called \u201CT-matrix
        method\u201D), including the previous article of KRISTENSSON, RAMM, and STR\xD6M
        (J. Math. Phys.24 (1983), 2619-2631) on the convergence of such methods.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-18T17:41:50Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-18T17:41:50Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2000</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        and Numerical Stability of the Second Waterman Scheme for Approximation of
        the Acoustic Field Scattered by a Hard Object</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Dallas,
        A.G.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>The numerical schemes of P.C. Waterman
        (J. Acoust. Soc. Am.45 (1969), 1417-1429), frequently referred to under the
        name of \"the T-Matrix method,\" have formed the basis for many scattering
        computations in many settings. However, no successful analyses of the algorithms
        have been published, so the limitations on their range of applicability and
        numerical stability remain largely unknown; this is of particular importance
        because of the apparently inconsistent success achieved in numerical experiments.
        Here, we give an operator condition that guarantees the viability of the algorithm
        and mean-square convergence of the far-field patterns generated by the second
        Waterman scheme for the case of time-harmonic acoustic scattering by a hard
        obstacle; we prove further that the operator condition holds at least whenever
        the scattering obstacle is ellipsoidal. For the convergence proof, we also
        assume that the square of the wavenumber is not an interior Dirichlet eigenvalue
        for the negative Laplacianl in the contrary case, we show that the algorithm
        is at best numerically ill-coordinated. With this and previous experience
        in numerical applications, it appears that the performance of the algorithm
        is markedly shape-dependent; for certain obstacles, e.g., ellipsoids, instabilities
        are so localized in wavenumber that they are practically numerically irrelevant,
        while it is not clear whether the erratic results found in applications to
        various other shapes arise from a failure of convergence or form numerical
        instability.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-18T17:46:49Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-18T17:46:49Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2000</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        Analytical Determination of the Pareto Optima of a Differentiable Mapping,
        I: Domains in Finite-Dimensional Spaces</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Dallas, A.G.</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>The
        problem of locating the Pareto-optimal points of a differentiable mapping
        $F: {\\mathcal M}^N \\to {I\\kern-.30em R}^n$ is studied, with the domain
        ${\\cal M}^N$ a differentiable N-dimensional submanifold-without-boundary
        in a euclidean space ${I\\kern-.30em R}^{N_{0}}$ and $N_0 \\ge N \\ge n$.
        The case in which the domain is the closure of a bounded, regular, open subset
        of ${I\\kern-.30em R}^N$ is also discussed. The search is initiated from these
        observations: for a manifold-domain, (1) the image of any Pareto optimum lies
        in the boundary of the range of F; (2) a point of the boundary of the range
        of F that also lies in the range must be the image of a singular point of
        F, i.e., must appear amongst the singular values of the map. Further conditions
        are then needed to distinguish which of the singular values should be discarded
        because they belong to the interior of the range; local tests of this sort
        are given for the bicriterial case (n = 2). A search procedure based on the
        present developments can systematically determine all of the Pareto optima
        for sufficiently simple F. The conditions established here may be regarded
        as analogues of the classical ones for the determination of the global extrema
        of a real-valued differentiable function. The results proven are illustrated
        with single examples, including plots of the ranges, singular points, and
        singular values.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-18T17:50:29Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-18T17:50:29Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2000</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        using a series solution of the field away from this&#13;\ndomain. We first
        prove a decomposition for the Poincare-Steklov operator on this boundary into
        an isomorphism and a compact&#13;\nperturbation. This is proved using a novel
        argument in which the scattering problem is viewed as a perturbation of the

        effects of a natural disaster extend beyond the visable and tangible damage
        caused to the physical surroundings, and also involve a qualitative change
        in the nature of society. There is a change from a Gesellschaft- style society
        to one where relationships and interaction&#13;\nbetween people are based
        on Gemeinskhaft-style sentiments. An analysis of the reaction of volunteers
        in such situations must accordingly take account of this transformed nature
        of society.&#13;\n&#13;\nModern impersonal society normally provides little
        reason or scope for voluntaristic or altruistic actions. Inasmuch as there
        is volunteerism, it is generally channeled through some organized or organizational
        means, In contrast to this, disaster often evokes many and varied instances
        of volunteer activity, part of it in terms of previously planned organization,
        much of it spontaneous on a group or individual basis. Such a response, different
        from normal social life, is a consequence of the transformation whereby the
        basic sentiments&#13;\nshift from Gesellschaft to Gemeinschaft.&#13;\n&#13;\nSince
        even those organizations geared to disaster activities reach their maximum
        response through the utilization of volunteer activity, an awareress of transformation,

        theoretical and empirical literature has focused upon the reciprocal influence
        between the complex organization and its environment. Thompson and McEwen
        (1958), for example, have conceptualized organizational goals as dynamic in
        nature, requiring constant interaction between the organization and its environment.
        This interaction process often takes the form of a power relationship, with
        both organization and environment competing for domination. As a result, organizations
        must adopt strategies for coming to terms with the environment, simply to
        ensure survival. Randall (1973, p. 236) describes such strategies as involving
        the process of building, and then maintaining environmental support for organizational
        goals and objectives, products or services, policies or programs.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-26T15:48:20Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-26T15:48:20Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1975</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/373</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        social activities (Stallings, 1970). Of equal importance, they necessitate
        some collective response (Quarantelli, Weller and Wenger, forthcoming). From
        that very fact they are not only necessarily attention from that very fact

        have consistently captured human imagination. Throughout the Old Testament,
        the frequency with which disasters are central or incidental themes suggests
        that they have always been a familiar part of man's experience&#13;\nand they
        have been a rather constant setting for posing questions about man's existence
        and death. Today, an examination of the news media forces one to the conclusion
        that disasters continue to be worthy of attention. We accept this attention
        as natural, and perhaps it is, since disasters continue to provide the context
        in which significant human dramas are revealed. Disasters are perhaps one
        of the few situations in which there is both the opportunity for the expression
        of heroism as well as for the ability to confront fear and suffering, And
        this is played out on a rather dramatic stage for the spectators to see. For
        those persons whose lives are characterized by the repetitiveness of day-to-day
        living, disasters provide a vicarious contact with these rather universa1
        themes.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-26T17:28:32Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-26T17:28:32Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1972</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/375</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        can provide an exceptional opportunity for the comparative analysis of social
        systems, Disaster events are particularly useful for comparative purposes
        since they activate a variety of structures and processes with which the social
        system attempts to cope. In addition, disaster events allow for the observation
        of complex intergroup and interinstitutional relationships which in \"normal
        times\" usually emerge more slowly and segmentally.  Such complexity&#13;\nis
        often slighted in most other comparative research since methodologies are
        used which place a premium on precision and abstraction rather than on the
        real complexities of social interrelationships. Disaster events are also useful
        for comparative purposes not only in understanding the more immediate adaptation
        of social systems but also because they are significant in understanding long-range

        today is experiencing a growth of interest and literature? in the subarea
        of interorganization relations, However, this development has been primarily
        theoretical and conceptual with a lesser emphasis being placed on the empirical
        testing of the propositions being developed. It is the purpose of this paper
        to broaden the empirical foundation in this area by operationalizing&#13;\nand
        testing Littmk and Heyer's balance theory of coordination between organizations
        and community primary groups. This test will be made utilizing data regarding

        a considerable challenge to a wide range of organizations in any affected
        community. Scarce resources, extreme time constraints, and disruption of channels
        of communication and modes of transportation often push organizations to the
        limits of their capabilities.  Yet some organizations are overloaded while
        others are barely affected. A number of students of organizations (for example,
        Haas and Drabek, 1973, and Price, 1967) have grappled with the complex and
        difficult issues of organizational characteristics and environmental demands.
        The Disaster Research Center (DRC) at&#13;\nThe Ohio State University has
        studied aspects of this for specific organizations in the past (for example,
        Kennedy, 13784 Adam, 1978; Ross, 19703. However, a&#13;\ndifferent perspective
        can be taken. Regardless of exactly how an organization meets the tasks imposed
        by a diaster situation, its legitimacy and long-term success often are linked
        more with how  the public in general thinks the organization&#13;\nperformed
        than with actual organizational experience.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-26T21:42:46Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-26T21:42:46Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1976</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/381</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        is how the dead are treated by the living, especially suddden and unaticipated
        large numbers of the dead. In this paper we present a case study of the handling
        of 237 victims of a flash flood disaster. Our descriptive analysis incorporates
        two levels of behavior: individual modes of adjustment and the organized response
        of the community. An examination is also made of the factors affecting the
        respect accorded the \"prerogatives\" of the dead and the living, and the
        remarkably effective organized carrying out of this generally non-instrumental
        disaster task.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-27T19:35:16Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-27T19:35:16Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1976-01</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/383</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        the immediate aftermath of a flood, tornado, hurricanes, or other natural
        disaster, it has been observed that there is a heightened enactment of mechanical
        solidarity and shared sentiment in the impacted community. Turner (1967) has
        argued that this enactment of solidarity is crucial in order to recreate the
        continued assurance of agreement on the priority of community values. Once
        this assurance is given, then a new and more effective division of labour
        can emerge in order to cope with the tasks created by the impact. Dynes and
        Quarantelli (1975) have identified seven factors associated with this apparent
        absence of conflict in the early stages of a disaster situation. These include
        the development of an emergency consensus, the levelling of social distinctions,
        and the strengthening of community identity.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-27T19:50:38Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-27T19:50:38Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1976-02</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/384</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        for carrying them out. In large part, the direction of response of groups

        it is seldom involved in community disaster planning. In addition, in traditional
        community disaster planning, educational personnel are often only incidentally
        involved in the planning process. The position we take hear is that educational
        systems have important reasons to become involved in disaster planning. The
        schools\u2019 involvement in disaster planning should extend beyond enacting
        simple sets of protective actions suggested by other sources. Such involvement
        requires the thinking out of implications of disasters for the schools themselves
        as well as the understanding of how the educational system relates to other
        community structures which must respond to the disasters.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-27T21:14:01Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-27T21:14:01Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1976-03-31</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/388</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        a systematic and comparative study of the delivery of emergency medical services
        (EMS) in large-scale and relatively sudden mass casualty producing situations

        from the efforts to provide EMS in turbulent social environments such as natural
        and technological disasters and other catastrophic crisis situations with

        work on community health care delivery systems in localities involved in disasters
        and similar events, as well as on systems likely to have to handle or at least
        to have to prepare to handle high potential mass casualty events.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-02-27T21:24:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-02-27T21:24:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1976-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/389</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        behavior are discussed in detail, and contrasted with prevailing misconceptions.
        &#13;\n&#13;\nThree covert features of the behavior are examined: its anticipatory
        nature, its focus on specific referent point, and the acute fear reaction
        involved. &#13;\n&#13;\nThree overt features of the behavior are also looked
        at: its flight nature and accompanying non-social and non-rational aspects.
        &#13;\n&#13;\nSome passing indications are also given of the absolute and

        reported are drawn from an initial analysis of the data gathered by the Disaster
        Research Center (DRC) in actual field studies of nearly 100 different disasters
        since late 1963. Thus, the report covers the functioning of local EOCs in
        almost all major natural catastrophes and many of moderate magnitude in the
        United States in the last eight years, as well as their use in some related
        community emergencies (e.g., major explosions, forest fires, dam breaks, etc.)

        looking at the notion of organizations as victims and illustrated it in the
        massive racial civil disturbances in the United States from 1964 through 1969
        (Dynes and Quarantell, 1970). This paper updates and extends that earlier
        preliminary version in a number of ways. We include a wider range of data,
        pay more attention to the difference among the various disturbances as well
        as the range of illegal activity undertaken in them, and generally attempt
        a more systematic theoretical examination of organizational victimology on

        involved, three in Midwest and one in the south central section of the United
        States, are all major metropolitan centers with a substantial nonwhite population.
        Some of these cities have experienced civil disorders in their recent past,
        others have not. However, no systematic attempt is made to relate past events
        with those under examination in this analysis. Each disturbance is primarily

        agents</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Communities throughout the world are
        subject to the disruptive impacts of a variety of disaster agents. From a
        sociological perspective, the impact of a flood, hurricane, tornado, earthquake,
        or some other agent may be considered as disaster when the agent presents
        demands and threats to a community which cannot be met by the institutionalized
        means that are utilized for its normal emergencies. When disaster strikes,
        a community must replace its routine social system with alterative activities
        and forms of organization that are more appropriate to the disaster context.
        Typically, much of the activity and organization which are utilized by the
        community in responding to the disaster emerge during the actual stress of
        the disaster situation. Often, however, the shape of disaster response depends
        in part upon a community\u2019s past experience with similar events. That
        is, previous community disaster activity provides some residue of learning
        which is applied to subsequent situations. When these residues are preserved,
        we can speak of community possessing a \u201Cdisaster subculture.\u201D Preservation,
        therefore, is the essence of a disaster subculture. One the one hand, the
        residues of learning are applied to aid in the community\u2019s survival.
        On the other hand, the subculture itself is preserved through time by the
        transmission of its elements to new community members. The true indication
        of the existence of a disaster subculture, therefore, is the perpetuation
        of successful patterns of adaptation to the disaster context through socialization.
        These subcultures appear to develop in many communities that experience repetitive
        impact from specific disaster agents.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-01</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-01</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1973-06</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/399</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        which focused on individual trauma. Such reportage, in addition, often implies

        typical emergency patient most often becomes an input into the organization

        emergency facility of the hospital, during crisis or large-scale disaster

        twenty-third spread the fire down the hills toward the city's suburbs.  For
        the next 36 hours the residents of the city were directly threatened by the
        fire.  More than 10,000 persons were forced to evacuate their homes by the
        evening of September 24.  Some seventy-eight homes were actually destroyed
        by the fire.  Danger to the city and suburbs ended by the morning of the twenty-sixth;
        the fire, however, continued to burn for another five days, not being declared
        officially out until  October 1.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-01T20:46:44Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-01T20:46:44Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1974</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/404</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        has remained the same.&#13;\n&#13;\n     At the time of its founding the Center
        set as its major research objective the analyzing of emergency organizations
        and their response to as well as prior planning for large scale community
        emergencies, particularly where a natural disaster agent is involved.  This
        focus was taken becausewhile there had been prior studies of disaster reponses,
        they had primarily focused on the victims.  Particularly no attention had
        bben given to the activities of the emergency organizations in the community,
        even though the actions of scuh groups generally determine the efficiency
        and effectiveness of the reactions in the emergency period.  In a basic sense,
        this focus on organizations during the emergency period has continued to be
        the major focus in most of the studies undertaken by the Center.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-01T21:39:23Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-01T21:39:23Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1974</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/405</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        situations present extraordinary contexts for delivery of emergency medical
        services (EMS).  Not only is there an increased demand for services in terms
        of caseload at the point of entry into the emergency medical system, often
        at the same time and place; but the capabilities of the system are tested
        in terms of the degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which components
        are able to coordinate and mobilize their resources to meet that demand.  (Taylor,
        1974), These capabilities are tested at a time when various agencies are often
        pursuing their own primary tasks, which may be peripheral in terms of usual
        conceptualizations of EMS, such as the provision of shelter, fire protection
        and traffic control.  Agencies involved in these tasks, as well as private
        citizens and other organizations, may exacerbate coordination with day-to-day
        EMS providers (Quarantelli, 1970).  A breakdown in one or several components
        of that system--agencies or organizations designated to deliver a particular
        service--may result, at worst, in the ineffective operation of the system
        (Stallings, 1970).</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-01T22:23:20Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-01T22:23:20Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1977</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/406</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        study of interorganizational relations has come of age in the past twenty
        years.  Early work by Selznick (1949), Thompson and McEwen (1958), and Dill
        (1958) has been developed and extended theoretically (Levine and White, 1961;
        Litwak and Hylton, 1962; Warreb, 1967; Benson, 1975) and methodologically
        (Evan, 1968; Turk, 1970).  The past ten years have provided an explosion of
        new research (White and Vlasak, 1972; White, 1974).  Recongnition of the importance
        of interorganizational factors can be seen in its diffusion into the organizational
        (White, 1974) and community (Craven and Wellman, 1973) literatures.  During
        the same period attempts were being made to consider the interorganizational
        as a social realm in its own right without anchoring research to internal
        effects on the participating organizations (Turk, 1970; Warren, 1967).</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-01T23:46:31Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-01T23:46:31Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1977</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/407</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        a disaster strikes a community it often leaves behind a path of destruction,
        including property damage, personal injury and death.  Often the magnitude
        of this destruction necessitates a community-wide response.  It has been suggested
        that when a community is hit by a disaster agent certain adaptations are required
        so that the community can recover and return to normal.  In order to explain
        this phenomena two social scientists, Charles Fritz (1961) and Allen Barton
        (1970) have developed the concept of a therapeutic community.  This concept
        refers to the emergence of a new social order which arises to meet the new
        demands and needs created by the catastrophe.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-02T01:45:34Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-02T01:45:34Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1977</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/409</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Factors In The Minimization Of Role Conflict: A Re-Examination Of The Significance
        Of Multiple Group Membership In  Disaster</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Dynes, Russell

        conflict</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>It is a standard sociological view
        that human beings play multiple roles.  Implicit in the idea of multi-role
        enactment is the possibility that a person may simultaneously be called upon
        to manifest two conflicting or competing roles.  Thus, the concept of role
        conflict is established.&#13;\nRole conflict was one of the first sociological
        concepts to be used in the area of disaster study.  In fact, one article by
        Killian using this concept was among the earliest to appear in the professional
        literature on disasters and has been widely quoted and cited, both in the
        disaster area and in sociology generally.&#13;\nHowever, studies we have conducted
        lend very little support to the presence of role conflict in disaster.  We
        document this with a systematic analysis of organizational role behavior in
        six major disasters.  The analysis shows a lack of evidence for the behavioral
        consequences of role conflict in disaster operations.&#13;\nOur explanation
        for this finding follows these lines.  Most formulations of role conflict
        are based on examining the social pschological processes of the actor.  Such
        a view implicity assumes that role obligations are somewhat constant.  They
        are not in disasters.  In such mass emergencies, there are certain types of
        structural shifts which not only mitigate the potential behavioral consequences
        of role conflict, but also provide the conditions for the reinforcement of
        relevant emergency roles by the family.&#13;\nThree factors seem especially
        important.&#13;\n(1) There are radical shifts in the institutional structure
        within the disaster-impacted community which minimize potential role conlficts
        strain.  Certain irrelevant occupational roles are deactivated; the sanction
        system shifts.  Many elements within particular role sets are eliminated.
        Certain roles dimensions are no longer as relevant, e.g. ascriptive dimensions,
        status dimensions, etc.  The division of labor is reshuffled.  There is a
        \"despecialization\" of the role structure and a movement back to more diffuse
        role obligations. The net effect seems to be to release the person from potentially
        conflicting obligations by simplifying the role structure.&#13;\n(2) Not all
        positions are relevant for emergencies, but there are key emergency organizations.
        \ Roles    within key emergency organizations contain dimensions which create
        explicit expectations for behavior in emergency situations.  Emergency relevant
        roles have built-in mechancisms for resolving conflict or have structural
        dimensions which reduce it.  &#13;\n(3) Many family norms encourage or supplement
        occupational performance in mass emergencies.  Some&#13;\nfamily roles are
        dependent upon successful occupational performance.  Also, expressive dimensions
        tend to reinforce emergency obligations.  The family is the \"role budget\"
        center in which various types of role allocations are made. Other members
        of the family pick up internal obligations to immediate family, kin, neighbors,
        etc., which allows certain family members to particate in emergency roles.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-02T02:32:50Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-02T02:32:50Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1977</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/410</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        death is essentially an excusion into a work situation and its activities,
        actors, and settings.  That is, there is a social structure implicit, if not
        explicit, in the body handling process.  It is this social structure which
        will be the focus of this paper.  Given the taboo nature of death in the American
        culture, (Vernon, 1970) the general public and even various professionals
        are typically \"protected\" from the post-death activities which are carried
        out by \"professional body handlers,\" i.e., morgue attendents coroners, funeral
        home personnel, and funeral directors.  However, in a disaster situation involving
        mass casulties it may become necessary to include other actors, i.e., volunteers,
        in the body handling process.  In addition, the activities of the task structure
        whith respect to the bodies are consideably altered in the aftermath of a
        disaster.  The task structure is greatly elaborated and the division of labor
        becomes much more complex than it would be in a normal death situation.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-03T02:26:16Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-03T02:26:16Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1977</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/416</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        supports commonly held views, but rather because it establishes that certain
        things are not so, are different from what is widely believed, and advances
        new ways of looking at problems.  Much of the research into disasters by social
        and behavioral scientists has pointed out many mythological beliefs about
        disaster behavior and has indicated new ways of thinking about the phenomena
        being studied. Therefore, in the following remarks we want to set forth, in
        a very selective fashion, what sociological research has established about
        misconceptions as to disaster warnings and what such studies suggest as to
        untraditional ways of looking at the problem.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-03T02:42:00Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-03T02:42:00Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1977</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/417</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        began in 1966 with the National Academy of Sciences report, Accidental Death
        and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society and the passage of
        the Highway Safety Act. These events, together with a Presidential decision
        to put health care dollars into fighting heart disease and strokes, spurred
        the passage in 1973 of the Emergency Medical System Act. By promoting and
        funding the development of comprehensive coordinated regional systems, the
        EMS Act offered a design to organize a community\u2019s health facilities
        and resources into a system aimed at insuring that essential emergency health
        services would be available to all persons in the system\u2019s service area

        are a significant and persistent theme in the mass media in every society.
        Newspapers give them banner headlines. Radio presents on-the-spot reports.
        Television uses them to set the tone for the evening news. Movies use them
        as a basis for plots to feature well-known stars. The reasons for the media
        preoccupation are perhaps not as clear as the image they present. The image
        usually focuses on the suddenness of human need, followed by the struggle
        to mobilize assistance. There is a duality to the image \u2013one part focuses
        on damage, loss, tragedy and destruction while the other part focuses on heroism,
        optimism, healing, recovery, altruism and rebuilding. Because of this duality,
        disasters can become a collective projective test, providing an ambiguous
        form into which members of the society project their own meanings. Some only
        see tragedy; others see altruism. Some only see loss; others see opportunity.
        Some only see the end of aspirations; others see the beginnings of hope and
        change. Some see the need to help; others see the helping which is needed.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-04</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-04</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1977</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/424</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Factors in the Minimization of Role Conflict: A Re-Examination of the Significance
        of Multiple Group Membership in Disasters</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Quarantelli,
        E. L.</dc:creator>\n<dc:subject>role conflict</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>role
        behavior</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>It is a standard sociological view
        that human beings play multiple roles. Implicit in the idea of multi-role
        enactment is the possibility that a person may simultaneously be called upon
        to manifest two conflicting or competing roles. Thus, the concept of role
        conflict is established.&#13;\n&#13;\nRole conflict was one of the first sociological
        concepts to be used in the area of disaster study. In fact, one article by
        Killian using t his concept was among the earliest to appear in the professional
        literature on disasters and has been widely quoted and cited, both in the
        disaster area and in sociology generally.&#13;\n&#13;\nHowever, studies we
        have conducted lend very little support to the presence of role conflict in
        disasters. We document this with a systematic analysis of organizational role
        behavior in six major disasters. The analysis shows a lack of evidence for
        the behavioral consequences of role conflict in disaster operations.&#13;\n&#13;\nOur
        explanation for this finding follows these lines. Most formulations of role
        conflict are based on examining the social psychological processes of the
        actor. Such a view implicitly assumes that role obligations are somewhat constant.
        They are not in disasters. In such mass emergencies, there are certain types
        of structural shifts which not only mitigate the potential behavioral consequences&#13;\nof
        role conflict, but also provide the conditions for the reinforcement of relevant
        emergency roles by the family.&#13;\n&#13;\nThree factors seem especially
        important.&#13;\n1)There are radical shifts in the institutional structure
        within the disaster-impacted community which minimize potential role conflicts
        strain. Certain irrelevant occupational roles are deactivated; the sanction
        system shifts. Many elements within particular role sets are eliminated.  Certain
        role dimensions are no longer as relevant, e.g., ascriptive dimensions, status
        dimensions, etc. The division of labor is reshuffled. There is a \"despecialization\"
        of the role structure and a movement back to more diffuse role obligations.
        The net effect seems to be to release the person from potentially conflicting
        obligations by simplifying the role structure.&#13;\n2)Not all positions are
        relevant for emergencies, but there are key emergency organizations. Roles
        within key emergency organizations contain dimensions which create explicit
        expectations for behavior in emergency situations. Emergency relevant roles
        have built-in mechanisms for resolving conflict or have structural dimensions
        which reduce it.&#13;\n3)Many family norms encourage or supplement occupational
        performance in mass emergencies. Some family roles are dependent upon successful
        occupational performance. Also, expressive dimensions tend to reinforce emergency
        obligations.  The family is the \"role budget\" center in which various types
        of role allocations are made. Other members of the family pick up internal
        obligations to immediate family, kin, neighbors, etc., which allows certain
        family members to participate in emergency roles.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-04</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-04</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1978</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/425</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        do organized elements of social systems respond when component sub-units such
        as communities are devastated? This is, on what do extra-community agencies

        arise, and how are they solved when a particular geographic area undergoes
        massive destruction of live and property as a result of a sudden catastrophe?
        If it is true that the structure and functioning of social systems, as well
        as of individuals, can be more clearly discerned in extreme situations, knowledge
        of actual group responses in such situations should contribute to an understanding
        of the fundamentals of social life. What is ignored and what is singled out

        the community and organizational preparations and planning for acute chemical
        hazard disasters. The results are drawn from data gathered on disaster preparedness
        in 14 communities and six major threats or actual disasters involving chemical
        agents in American Society.&#13;\n&#13;\nA model for describing and analyzing
        community and organizational disaster planning is outlined. Some initial observations
        are stated about how communities rank the probability of different kinds of
        disasters including chemical ones. We then present in general terms a series
        of finding about community and organizational perceptions and reactions with
        respect to chemical threats, resources to deal with such threats and social
        organization of emergency related groups using such resources and social climate
        in which the emergency groups operate. Some implication for planning are then

        behavior of human beings in relatively small scale emergencies ranging from
        fires in hotels, night clubs and high rise buildings to massive catastrophes
        such as the earthquake-fire situation of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake,
        and the 1923 Great Kwanto earthquake in Japan. There are, of course, many
        reasons for this interest, but a major one is undoubtedly the concern as well
        as the fascination with the idea that people in such extreme stress situations
        may \u201Cpanic.\u201D It seems to be also generally assumed that the panic
        behavior which may occur is basically maladaptive, i.e., adds to the loss
        of life and injuries which the physically destructive agent could have caused
        by itself. In short, panic is a focus of attention because it is thought to
        be a major potential human problem in most sudden extreme stress situations,
        including many fire emergencies.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-04T01:42:46Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-04T01:42:46Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1979-02</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/429</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        descriptions of disaster events place a great deal of emphasis on the damage
        done to life, physical structures and facilities. Financial estimates of the
        destruction caused by the disaster agent, together with accounts of the number
        of dead and injured, comprise the commonly accepted standard for gauging disaster
        severity. However, disasters also exact social costs over and above the damage
        to life and property. Indeed, it can be argued that it is precisely this element
        \u2013 the sudden disruption of social life \u2013 that distinguishes disasters
        from other destructive or costly events such as accidents, personal or family
        tragedies and economic depression. The notion that some degree of stress in
        community social organizations is present in all disasters is expressed explicitly
        in widely quoted definitions which define a disaster as  an event, concentrated
        in time and space, in which a society or a relatively self-sufficient subdivision
        of a society undergoes severe danger and incurs such losses to its members
        and physical appurtenances that  the social structure is disrupted and the
        fulfillment of all or some of the essential functions of society is prevented

        in both the types of events and the range of services provided, a move to

        Account</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Earthquake-Case Studies</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Disasters
        are usually identified as having occurred at a particular time and place,
        but they also occur at a particular time in human history and within a specific
        social and cultural context.  Consequently, it is appropriate to call the
        Lisbon earthquake the first modern disaster (Dynes, 1999).  Certainly, earlier
        history records many instances of geophysical events and the differences among
        such events were typically explained by variations in their physical intensity.
        \ However, the Lisbon earthquake occurred at a time and a place which made
        it a part of the debate over modernity.  Its location in Europe made it a
        topic in the intellectual debates of the times.  These debates had greater
        impact on the changing cultural context than the physical intensity of the
        earthquake might imply.  The earthquake occurred when there were many strains
        between tradition and new ideas about progress.  It was a time when traditional
        ideas and institutions were being challenged, when nation states were being
        created, and when rivalries among states led to tensions and conflict.  Further,
        it was a time when the bonds of traditional religious authority were being
        challenged by a growing enthusiasm for intellectual freedom and for reason.
        \ These major political and institutional shifts were reflected in the meanings
        that were assigned to the Lisbon earthquake.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-04T13:47:58Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-04T13:47:58Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1999</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/435</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        cautious and hesitant about taking certain actions due to their assumptions

        One is a a personal reason- this ysmposium will allow me to meet distinguished
        researchers and scholars I have heard or read about(such as Professor Geipel
        and Dr. Frey) ,but have never met. Such personal meetings will allow me to
        learn about studies and works that are new to me.&#13;\nBut, the other reason
        I am glad to be here is a more professional one.  An international symposium
        such as this one on disasters and accidents is important for what it symbolizes.

        study on disaster, the \"Halifax-Explosion\" by Prince (1920) and the study
        by Carr (1932) on a general disaster-stage-model, the sociological research
        on disasters has mushroomed not only linearly but exponentially (Quarantelli,1978:
        2).  To a certain extent, this growth might have been induced by the auto-dymanics
        of academia (see Kreps, 1979; Quarantelli, 1979), but in the main it reflects
        the fact that the traditional modes of explaining and coping with disasters
        had become meaningless and insufficient.  \"Modern\" societies, characterized
        by perpetual social change and cultural development, were facing the need
        for new modes of explanation and better ways of coping with disasters.  The
        reasons for this need are described by B. A.

        in an interorganization field (IOF) refers to representative decision-making
        and communication between coordinating unit(s) and member units.  On the other
        hand, an IOF consists of decision-making units coupled with each other by
        directive- and report-information flows.  Centralization or decentralization
        is one important dimension of decision-making structure, and is defined by
        the number of representative decision unit(s) in an IOF.  Also crucial is
        the concentration-diffuseness dimension of the communication structure which
        refers to the distance between the representative decision unit(s) and member
        units.  Then, while an organization is characterized by relatively high centralization
        and diffuseness, as well as by representativeness based on authority, an IOF
        will be either high or low in centralization and conconcentration.  In addition,
        the representativeness of an IOF is based on contracts for the mandate or
        concession of decision-making rights.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-04T18:26:01Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-04T18:26:01Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1981</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/443</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        report consists of eight chapters.  Each chapter deals with a major issue
        in regard to the implementation of disaster planning, indicates central questions
        with respect to that issue, and makes some major points in relation to each
        question.  The discussion in all cases is based on what studies of actual
        situations show and in this sense is grounded in research-derived findings
        rather than being based on unrealistic suppositions or desirable but unattainable
        ideal circumstances. A basic theme running throughout the report is that implementation
        of disaster planning cannot be achieved through the mechanical application
        of a fixed set of procedures but requires instead a careful analysis of the
        particular constellation of conditions present in each individual case, and
        a willingness of some organization such as local civil defense to take the
        initiative in developing and/or maintaining community emergency plans.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-04T18:48:45Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-04T18:48:45Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1978</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/444</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        some of its earlier work as an initial base for developing a research design,
        the Disaster Research Center in 1975 began a systemic and comparative study
        of the delivery of emergency medical services (EMS) in relatively large-scale,
        sudden mass casualty-producing situations in the United States.  For comparative
        purposes, more limited studies on preplanned events with high mass caualty
        potentials and on the disaster EMS planning and everyday operations in some
        disaster-prone communities were also undertaken.  This paper advances a series
        of recommendations regarding the policies, planning, practices and research
        implementations involved in the delivery of EMS in disasters, which were derived
        from the 28 month study.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-04T19:45:22Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-04T19:45:22Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1980</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/448</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        looting, and other antisocial behavior; of dazed and stunned victims unable

        of the earliest research topics in the disaster area was the issuance of emergency
        warnings and the reactions to them. This is understandable. If persons can
        be warned of a threat, they can take preventive, mitigatory, precautionary,
        and protective measures, including evacuating themselves out of an endangered
        area. Warnings can obviously be useful it not necessary for adaptive behavior
        to environmental changes \u2013natural or manmade \u2013 which put life, property,
        group routines, and the ecological balance in peril. It is not therefore surprising
        that when social and behavioral scientists started to do research on disasters
        about 30 years ago, many of the studies focused on the question of disaster
        warnings and reactions of potential victims to them. This interest has persisted
        over the years.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T14:55:54Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T14:55:54Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1982-06</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/452</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        even though a number of disaster studies looked at this phenomenon during
        the 1950\u2019s, is blame and scapegoating (Taylor, 1978:255). This neglect
        is rather surprising, since it appears that the process of assigning blame
        occurs after may disasters (however, see Fritz, 1957 or Fritz and Williams,
        1957), and all Allport (1966:5) and Klapp (1972:191) observe, this process

        remarks will primarily deal with the principles of disaster planning as these
        can be derived from systematic social science studies. But before we can talk
        about principles, we need to clarify what is mean be disaster and by planning.
        Unless we agree one what we are talking about when we refer to disaster preparedness
        planning, there is little sense in talking of principles. In fact, as we shall
        note, social science research indicates that many problems in disaster preparedness
        stem from: 1) a failure to grasp what is basically involved in a disaster,
        and 2) a lack of understanding what constitutes good planning.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T15:35:19Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T15:35:19Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1982</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/458</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        groups</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>community</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>In
        this paper we explore the relationship between one type of grassroot social
        movement organization (SMO), emergent citizen groups in disaster (ECG) with
        other more community or regionally based SMO\u2019s. A basic tenet of the
        resource mobilization approach (e.g. McCarthy and Zald, 1973, 1977) is that
        SMO\u2019s cannot come into existence and maintain their existence without
        certain material and non-material resources. Grievances are not thought of
        as being an important variable in the social movement process. Walsh (1981)
        notes that studies from the resource mobilization approach generally have
        focused on national or regional SMO\u2019s (e.g., see Oberschall, 1973; Zald
        and McCarthy, 1979). Gambrell (1980) and Walsh (1981) contend that a bias
        exists against the studying of local SMO\u2019s. We attempt to look at the
        local and community/regional levels of SMO\u2019s and the relationship between
        them in regards to resource distribution. We hope to ascertain how local SMO\u2019s,
        such as ECG\u2019s, receive resources.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T16:25:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T16:25:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1983-02</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/460</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        paper examines potential conditions associated with the gender composition
        of one type of social movement organization, an emergent citizen group (ECG)
        in disaster. Knowledge of the gender composition of social movements represents
        an important addition to class, religious, ethnic, and attitudinal foci. This
        paper will comment on the (preliminary) conclusions of the formal voluntary
        organization and social movement literature concerning the role of gender
        in these social phenomena. The predominance of women in ECG\u2019s may be
        interpreted as a consequence of task structure, previous existing networks,
        recruitment strategies, perceived discretionary time, and perceived conflict
        between involvement in ECG\u2019s and commitment to other roles.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T16:33:55Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T16:33:55Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1983-04</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/461</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Today (a nationwide newspaper whose content consists primarily of extremely
        brief news items), one could speculated that the future of the newspaper will
        rest in the hands of a society unwilling to devote time to reading, and/or
        not interested in journalistic details of news events. If so, it is simple
        to hypothesize that he print media will lose its important role in society
        compared to other forms of present and emerging mass media technologies. However,
        the history of the newspaper industry suggests that such an assumption may
        be unwise, for other instances of evolution in the past have failed to produce
        the expected demise of diminution of the social functions of the print media.
        A review of the media-related literature about the development of post-industrial
        societies, the spread of the urbanization process, and the advent of radio
        and television, easily show how newspapers have successfully adapted to these
        events, and maintained an integral role in the American mass communication
        system.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T16:42:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T16:42:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1983-09</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/462</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Disaster Research Center (DRC) undertook a nationwide study of private citizens
        who organize themselves in groups to prepare for or to recover from disasters.
        Part of that research looked for citizen groups preparing for earthquakes.
        We found that there are, relatively and absolutely, few earthquake preparedness
        citizen groups. To explain this finding, we detail and explanatory model which
        specifies the conditions necessary for the general emergence of citizen groups,
        and apply it to the likelihood of the appearance, development, and survival
        of earthquake preparedness groups. Some of the atypical characteristics, careers,
        and consequences for the few such groups found by our study, are also noted.
        Given the atypical nature and the scarcity of earthquake oriented citizen
        groups, we note the implications for earthquake planning in general.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T16:51:59Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T16:51:59Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1983-11</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/463</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        the problem. However, very little attention has been paid to the behavioral,
        that is, the human and group aspects of the matter. To begin to close this
        gap in knowledge, the Disaster Research Center (DRC) in 1977, under a three

        or the living next to hazardous waste sites. While many issues are involved,
        a central one is the question of the psychological impact on the affected
        population. If the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania were to be started
        up again, would there be negative mental health consequences for the area
        residents? Have there been deleterious mental effects as a result of the exposure
        to hazardous wastes in the Times Beach, Missouri situation? Public hearings,
        court cases, and mass media accounts associated with these and similar events

        threat of sudden chemical disasters is on the increase. However, while the
        technical aspects of such incidents have been much studied, the social aspects
        of such situations have been largely ignored. To study this problem the Disaster
        Research Center recently concluded a four year study of community and organizational
        preparedness for and responses to actual and potential sudden disasters resulting
        from chemical agents. Field studies were conducted on preparedness planning
        in 19 communities around the United States; and additional 20 field studies
        were undertaken of responses in the emergency time period of incidents involving
        chemical explosions, fires, and spills. Using a sociological framework which
        is indicated relevant variables and factors, intensive interviews were obtained
        from over 400 respondents. In addition, considerable data were gathered from
        participant observing and document collecting. The data were quantitatively
        and qualitatively analyzed, and a general theoretical model of preparedness
        and response was derived. In this paper the major findings about the sociobehavioral
        aspects of disaster preparedness for and of the organizational and community
        responses to chemical disasters are briefly summarized.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T17:23:41Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T17:23:41Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1984</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/467</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Federal Bureau of Land Reclamation released water over dams in the Colorado
        river system, to relieve reservoirs swollen by record runoff from late spring
        snows in the Rocky Mountains. By the middle of July, and downstream, the released
        water pushed the Colorado over its banks in its worst flooding in decades
        in Arizona, resulting in at least seven deaths and millions of dollars in
        property damage. What federal officials called controlled flooding contaminated
        underground wells, damaged hundreds of homes, and furnished ample breeding
        ground for millions of mosquitoes, raising fear of encephalitis and other
        diseases. The flooding was foreseen as lasting until September or later in
        Arizona and other states.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T17:31:16Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T17:31:16Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1984</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/468</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        adverse or potentially adverse situations has been a growing phenomenon since
        the 1970\u2019s (Boyte, 1980; Henig, 1982).  Issues regarding these situations
        may include consumerism, anti-crime, riot mitigation, the environment, and
        natural or man-caused disasters.  In order to accomplish various tasks in
        regard to these various issues, grass roots social movement organizations
        (SMO\u2019s) are often mobilized by concerned citizens.  Using data from a
        nationwide study we look at the relationship between one type of SMO, an emergent
        citizen group (ECG) in a disaster \u2013related situation, and selected key
        local organizations.  In this analysis, a collective behavior and organizational
        approach are combined.  This tack allows us to analyze the ECG as it develop
        within its organizational set (see Evan, 1976), and even analyze the emergence
        of an organizational set (see Ross, 1980).  Using the ECG as our focal organization
        we look at the dominant direction of the flow of information between it and
        the key organizations as a fundamental factor of influence within the issue-organization
        set.  The consequences of the ECG\u2019s legitimacy and successes are then
        discussed in light of the patterns of relations or characteristics with the
        other members of the organizational set.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T19:46:39Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T19:46:39Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1984</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/470</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        seems to be general agreement that accidents, disasters, and catastrophes

        observers have known has been a growing trend.  Considerable research of a
        technical nature has been undertaken on the problem.  However, very little
        attention has been paid to the behavioral, that is, the human and group aspects
        of the matter.  To begin to close this gap in knowledge, we at the Disaster
        Research Center (DRC) in 1977 launched a four year study of sociobehavioral

        Myths</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>For over two decades students of disaster
        phenomena have attempted to accurately describe and explain the behavior of
        individuals, groups, and organizations during the pre-impact, trans-impact
        and post-impact periods.  As part of this effort, considerable attention has
        been paid to cataloguing \u201Cdisaster myths.\u201D  Fritz (1961) was one
        of the first researchers to discuss that many popular beliefs about disaster
        behavior are incorrect.  For example, the widely accepted beliefs in large-scale
        panic, looting and criminal activity, public shelter utilization, disaster
        shock and general anti-social behavior have been shown to be inaccurate.  Later
        Barton (1970), Dynes (1970) and Quarantelli and Dynes (1972)  further highlighted
        these mythical elements.  Wenger et.al. (1975) was able to empirically demonstrate
        that indeed the public does hold to these mistaken notions.  Not only do residents
        of non-disaster locales subscribe to these myths, but later research found
        that residents of three communities  with extensive disaster experience also
        possessed inaccurate information about these types of disaster behavior (Wenger
        et.al., 1984).</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T21:36:24Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-05T21:36:24Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1986</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/475</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        title I have given the remarks I will make is The Need for Planning, Training,
        and Policy on Emergency Preparedness. The need is not self-evident as might
        appear at first glance. Even when the need is recognized there is sometimes
        difficulty in seeing how the need can be communicated to others. And even
        when it is communicated to others, there frequently is an overlooking of the
        fact that the three elements\u2014planning, training and policy are not separate
        and independent, but intricately linked to one another. This, in part, is
        why although the emphasis of this symposium is on training, I think it is
        appropriate to look at the training in a larger context.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-06T18:15:40Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-06T18:15:40Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1985</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/477</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Post Disaster Mitigation: A Sociological Perspective</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Dynes,
        Russell R.</dc:creator>\n<dc:subject>disaster planning</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>mitigation</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>sociological
        perspective</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Often a title of a paper is not
        a sufficient guide to its content. However, within the title there is some
        indication that there is some \u201Csociological\u201D perspective concerning
        post-disaster mitigation. In most interdisciplinary conferences, it is somehow
        assumed that a \u201Csociologist\u201D is a defender of people. And people
        are usually seen as being problematic to any cherished or planned post-disaster
        activity. Of the assumption is made that certain activities are appropriate
        and important for mitigation, but they fail because of the \u201Cpeople\u201D.
        Consequently, this problematic source \u2013the people\u2014are considered
        the province of sociologist with the implication that, if sociologist were
        able to \u201Csolve\u2019 the people problem, all else would be right with
        the world, especially since technological schemes could b implemented. Such
        schemes are assumed to be in the interest of the people anyway. Thus, it is
        assumed that if sociologist can solve the people problem, planning efforts
        would usher us into some new utopia. The role of sociologist is considered
        residual, rather than central, in the planning process.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-06T18:24:15Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-06T18:24:15Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1985</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/478</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        is the best configuration or relationship for disaster or mass emergency planning
        between the scientific research system and the administration system (or research
        users as they are called in the United States)? This is a question that has
        been asked and answered in some way at the present time in perhaps two dozen
        countries around the world. The answer or the relationship that has been suggested
        and in some cases actually institutionalized varies somewhat from one nation
        to another. There are at least four reasons for this variation in the possible
        relationship between the research system and the administrative system. They
        are: 1). Differences in the social structures of different societies; 2) differences
        in what different countries include under disaster planning; 3) differences
        in whether an agent specific or a generic approach is taken to disaster planning;
        and 4) differences in the social science capability and disaster knowledge
        base in different societies.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-06T18:31:30Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-06T18:31:30Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1985</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/479</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        than a few observers of disaster research have charged that the field has

        charge that students of disasters have not utilized established sociological
        concepts in their analyses and that the potentially beneficial cross polination
        that could occur between the subfield and the broader discipline has not materialized.
        For example, in a massive review of the field of disaster research, Mileti,
        Drabek and Haas conclude with this observation. \u201CExisting studies on
        behavior in disaster have been conducted\u2026 as if no theory existed in
        the social sciences to provide a basis for the direction of inquiry\u2026
        The continued heavy reliance on this method, once development of the area

        and their relationship to basic and applied sociological research. The relationship
        could be looked at from the viewpoint of what is ought to be, or it could
        be examined from the perspective of what it actually is. We have chosen to
        discuss what is really done, rather than, ideally, what ought to be done.
        In fact, since most of our remarks and examples are drawn from the past, from
        the first decade or so of disaster research in the United States, we shall
        be talking not so much of what is done at present, but more about what happened
        in the past. In other words, we will talk about the very early days of systematic
        disaster research in this country and try to indicate in what ways applied
        and basic questions influenced the work that was undertaken, in that sense
        focusing on the \u201Cwas,\u201D rather than the \u201Cshould have been.\u201D</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-06T19:17:08Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-06T19:17:08Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1986-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/485</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        this little area of empirical examination has been known as \u201Cdisaster

        instance, it should be noted that the field is not called \u201Cdisaster studies\u201D
        or Disasterology.\u201D Logically, one can imagine \u201CDisasterology.\u201D
        It would probably be an independent discipline with its own concepts, theoretical
        explanations, and paradigms. Now it must be noted that some of our European
        friends, such as Carlo Pelanda, and some of our colleagues in this country,
        would prefer to have something like \u201CDisasterology\u201D (Swisher, 1985).
        They believe that the development of a unique discipline, fertilized through
        it would be by multidisciplinary contributions, is needed for the field to
        reach fruition.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-06T19:24:36Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-06T19:24:36Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1986</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/486</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        does not follow automatically from disaster planning. Research has shown that
        successful disaster management results primarily from the activities of emergency
        organizations. In particular, there are management problems with respect to
        the communication process, the exercise of authority, and the development
        of coordination. There are at least five different areas of difficulties in
        the communication process, namely in intra-organizational behaviors, between
        organizations, from organizations to the public, from the public to organizations,
        and with systems of organizations. Exercise of authority difficulties stem
        from losses of higher echelon personnel because of overwork, conflict regarding
        authority over new disaster tasks, clashes over organizational jurisdictional
        differences. Coordination difficulties come from lack of consensus among organizations
        working on common but new disaster related tasks, and difficulties in achieving
        overall coordination in any community disaster that is of any magnitude. Prior
        planning can limit these management difficulties but cannot completely eliminate
        all of them.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-06T19:31:54Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-06T19:31:54Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1986</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/487</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        for adults. In both types of facilities: 1) there is a collective providing
        of the daily necessities of life for their resident populations; 2) the population,
        whether known as patients or residents, expect to be and are ordered and controlled
        by the staff of the facilities; 3) the working staff is very heterogeneous;
        and 4) there are a variety of links to the outer world, such as relatives
        and friends of the patients or residents, suppliers of goods and services,
        and community and public officials. On the other hand: 1) hospitals are considered
        public resources with some responsibility for providing medical care for the
        community, but nursing homes are not so viewed; 2) hospitals are medical,
        whereas nursing homes are primarily custodial facilities; 3) hospitals have
        substantial and continual turnover in their patient population, whereas nursing
        home populations tend to be far more stable, and 4) there are likely to be
        more totally incapacitated patients in hospitals than in nursing homes.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-06T19:49:37Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-06T19:49:37Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1986</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/489</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        is no one in this audience who does not immediately recognize the descriptive
        referent of two phrases we will utter ---the Challenger space shuttle accident
        and the spread of AIDS virus. However, we would also venture to say, with
        confidence, that the quick recognition of what we are talking about would
        not be accompanied by a similar consensus that both one or the other, or neither,
        should be thought of as a disaster for research purposes. One the other hand,
        there is probably no one in this audience who will not only recognize, but
        agree, that the referents of the terms Bhopal and Chernobyl are, and should
        be, looked at as disaster. Why? Few of us would have trouble characterizing
        some aspects of the recent Mexico City earthquake or the Amaro, Columbia,
        volcanic mud slide as a disaster. Yet many of us would hesitate to characterize
        in the same way the clashes between the Soviet Union military and the native
        guerillas in Afghanistan, the American air strike on Lybia or the current
        war between Iran and Irak. Do the deaths from the famine in Ethiopia qualify
        as a disaster? If yes, what about the much larger number of people who die
        daily as a result of cigarette smoking? Why do we and other researchers characterize
        certain occurrences as disasters but deny this label for other phenomena also
        involving loss of life, substantial great destruction of property, and/or
        major disruption of social life?&#13;\n&#13;\nThis paper struggles with the
        problem of what we, as researchers, should study as a disaster. In our view,
        this is by far the most important task currently facing the field of disaster
        studies, as undertaken by social and behavioral scientists. We are not going
        to proclaim the definitive answer. Instead, we ask some questions and advance
        some suggestions for researchers about the concept of disaster.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-06T20:33:43Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-06T20:33:43Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1986</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/492</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        however the most critical one appears to be that the issue is highly complex.
        \ It is complex due to such factors as the diversity and heterogeneity of
        local community systems, the variety of local planning structures, the multidimensional
        elements that influence planning measures, and the paucity of research efforts
        focused upon the topic.  This complexity bodes ill for any who believe that

        assess, in any intelligent way, the preparedness planning for disasters requires
        asking the question:  what is good planning?  It would be possible to advance
        some ideal version of what should be, but we prefer to root our answers to
        the questions in the empirical research undertaken by social and behavioral
        scientists in the last three decades.  Part of this research is particularly
        strong on the community and organizational aspects of disaster planning.  The
        research cuts across natural and technological disaster agents, but is somewhat
        stronger on studies done in developed countries (i.e., industrialized and
        urbanized societies) than in developing countries.  There is, therefore, an
        issue on the question of how much the research findings can be extrapolated
        to all kinds of societies, so we will address the matter towards the end of

        the research results about behavior in major disasters rather than in emergencies

        research cannot be meaningfully addressed until some sort of answer is given
        to the more fundamental issue: what is a disaster? Kreps does provide one
        general answer in his paper. Regarding much of what he says, he clearly is
        right. The evidence for this conclusion comes from the fact hat many of his
        views correspond to mine\u2014obviously there could be no stronger confirmation
        that he is correct in expressing those views!&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\nHowever,
        I do have some problems with certain of his positions. In this brief commentary,
        let me discuss four matters regarding which I would take a different position
        than that which seems to be taken by Kreps. However, what is important is
        not that we disagree, but rather that the differences lead in different direction
        in conceptualizing disasters and developing typologies or taxonomies. So these
        are difference which make difference.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-07T22:49:31Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-07T22:49:31Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1988</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/502</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        non-random observations. But after over three decades of systematic social
        science research on organizational preparation for and managing of disasters,
        we have a solid base of knowledge that can be used for the purposes of assessing
        planning (see Barton, 1970; Dynes, 1974; Quarantelli, 1981b; Dynes, Quarantelli

        studies</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Systematic studies on disasters in the
        social and behavioral sciences are essentially a post World War II phenomena.
        It is true that the earliest scientific work in the area was a Ph.D. in sociology
        done at Columbia University on the social change associated with a massive
        explosion in writings on the topic in the next tow decades (Carr, 1932; Kutak,
        1938; Sorokin, 1942). However, these undertakings did not lead to any sustained
        or continuous research. But in the first few years of the early 1950s, a handful
        of sociologist in the United States initiated field research on the reactions
        of people especially in the emergency time periods of community disasters
        generated by agents ranging from tornadoes and earthquakes to explosions and
        plan crashes into residential areas (for a discussion of the historical context
        and development, see Quarantelli, 1986a; 1988c). These few scientific pioneers
        from sociology had very little idea that they were setting in motion the development
        of a new area for study, the considerable enterprise that exists today under
        the label of social science disaster research.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-07T23:15:02Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-07T23:15:02Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1988</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/505</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        increasingly noticeable feature of American society is the presence of newly
        formed groups of private citizens concerned with preventing and preparing
        for possible disasters or with recovering from actual impacts of such types
        of community crises. Their increased visibility and activity is probably reflective
        of broader trends in the country on the rights of consumers, and emphasis
        on participatory democracy, and an interest in organized self help, that are
        some of the legacies of the social turmoil of the late 60\u2019s and early
        70\u2019s  (for a partial examination of the historical background, see Boyte,
        1980). Apart from any changes in popular beliefs and values about the rights
        and obligations of individual citizens to work together, there has also been
        an increase in local community and formal advocacy groups interested in activating
        and mobilizing private citizens (examples of the variety of such groupings
        are presented in Freeman, 1983). Thus, it is not surprising that there are
        also a variety of public interest groups across the nation who are consciously
        undertaking deliberate efforts to educate and train people in disaster preparedness,
        response, recovery and mitigation. The larger changes in American society
        suggest that it should be anticipated that not only will emergent groups of
        citizens continue to surface in potential and actual disaster situations,
        but that their numbers are very likely to increase in the future.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-07T23:26:33Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-07T23:26:33Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1988</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/506</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        or prepare for both natural and technological community disasters. We particularly
        focus on the relationships of 12 local ECGs and other community organizations.
        Using a collective behavior approach we look at ECGs in terms of their organizational

        three volume, 960 page report, entitled Human Reactions in Disaster Situations
        issued in 1954 by the National Opinion Research center (NORC) at the University
        of Chicago, is a classic. Not because it has been widely read for very seldom
        do I encounter anyone who has ever seen a copy of the publication, much less
        perused it. Not because its specific contents are very well known and used
        as a starting base in current disaster research scientific circles; for different
        reasons the various summaries and inventories of disaster finding have not
        presented any of the data or findings, except by Barton who gives some limited
        and selective material in his now two decade old book, Communities in Disaster
        (1970: 130-138). And the NORC work, whether generally or specifically, is
        very seldom cited in the present day disaster research literature, and extremely
        few libraries have copies of the report. Rather our argument is the publication
        is a classic for two other reasons: 1) it primarily reports on what by most
        criteria which could be used is still the best survey study so far undertaken
        in the disaster area, and 2) because of the mostly unrecognized by highly
        significant influence the NORC work had done on the historical development
        of disaster studies in the United States and on how much of the current research
        in the area is conducted.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-07T23:45:44Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-07T23:45:44Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1989</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/508</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        behavior</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>In September 1985 a major earthquake
        hit Mexico, especially its capital city. In the metropolitan area of Mexico
        City thousands of persons were killed and tens of thousands were injured.
        At least a hundred thousand building units, mostly residential ones, were
        damaged in some way. Hundreds of thousands of the population were rendered
        homeless. Material and property losses amounted to billions of dollars. Most
        of the important federal governmental buildings, many financial and industrial
        offices, key communication centers, and the largest central district hotels
        were in the major impacted zones. In addition, 30 percent of hospital beds
        in the city were lost as well as 22 percent of school facilities, and more
        than 10,000 shops and factories were affected. Obviously all this considerably
        disrupted everyday life in the largest urban complex in the world. Thus, what
        happened by an criteria was a major disaster although perhaps not a catastrophic
        one given the population base and community resources involved (e.g., the
        residents in the metropolitan area number over 20,000,000 and the directly
        affected neighborhoods amounted to only 3.2 percent of the whole federal district).</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-07T23:54:18Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-07T23:54:18Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1989</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/509</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        we first want to indicated why such knowledge from systematic study is important.
        &#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\nIt is important because no planning for disasters, no
        managing of them, can be any better than the assumptions which are made. In
        preparing and in responding there are necessarily assumption being made about
        the behavior of the human beings and groups involved in the situation. It
        obviously follows that if valid assumptions are made, it raises probability
        that the disaster planning and managing will be good; it also follows that
        if incorrect assumptions are made the opposite is likely to be true.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-08</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-08</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1989</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/510</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        a variety of very complex matters which need to be addressed in any practical
        and/or theoretical discussion about the issue. It makes a difference in consequences
        as to what something is called.  Second, we will highlight and summarize some
        ten general themes from the research literature about what is known about
        those who are assisted in the recovery effort after disasters. There are substantial
        differences regarding for instance the sources of aid, the kinds of help provided,
        and the effects of the assistance given to victims\u2014especially at the
        individual, family and household levels\u2014in the recovery process. Third,
        we will conclude with a few briefer comments about what the research literature
        says about those who give or provide recovery assistance in the aftermath
        of a disaster. The givers or providers are somewhat different and have more
        complex problems than usually recognized.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-08</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-08</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1989</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/512</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Aspects of Disaster Planning in Developing Countries</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Quarantelli,

        this paper we discuss seven related matters or issues: 1) that planning for
        disasters encompasses four different but related aspects, namely mitigation
        or prevention, preparedness, response and recovery. We shall note that while
        the research knowledge is uneven about the different phases, nonetheless the
        necessity of linking them in the planning process is clear. 2) possible social
        differences between developing and developed countries that have implication
        for disaster planning. This is necessitated by the fact that the great bulk
        of disaster research has been undertaken in developed countries; the extrapolation
        or applicability of the research results to the situation in developing countries
        has to be considered. 3) in what ways, if any, a rural way of life differs
        from an urban one given that almost all developing societies are basically
        rural in nature. If there are some major differences, they would have important
        implications for disaster planning. 4) the criteria which can be used to assess
        disaster planning. Sets of such criteria have implicitly or explicitly been
        advanced in a variety of sources so we will primarily confine ourselves to
        presenting mostly a checklist that could be used, taking into account all
        the four phases of disaster planning. 5) the extent to which disaster planning
        can be integrated into developmental planning, particularly as the latter
        takes regional form. In a short examination, we will assess the extent to
        which such integration can occur with respect to the four aspects of disaster
        planning. 6) the nature of the possible participation of citizens and local
        communities in disaster planning. In a selective discussion, we shall give
        some indications what research in the disaster area suggests about getting
        citizen and community involvement, and 7) that the future will not be the
        same as the past or even the present insofar as disaster planning is concerned.
        Not only are developing societies ever changing, but the nature of disasters
        themselves are in flux moving us towards more and worse disasters.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-08T01:35:56Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-08T01:35:56Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1990</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/516</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        planning</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Community emergency planning had its
        roots in military analogies which viewed emergencies as extensions of \u201Cenemy
        attack\u201D scenarios. Such thinking was embedded in early structural arrangements
        and was generalized as the appropriate normative model for all emergencies.
        This model viewed emergencies as conditions of social chaos which could be
        rectified by command and control. It is argued here that such a view is inadequate
        based on a knowledge of behavior in emergencies and the model is dysfunctional
        for planning. A more adequate model is presented, based on conditions of continuity,
        coordination and cooperation. This problem solving model, based on research
        rather than military analogies, provides a more adequate set of assumptions
        as the basis for planning. However, legislative and technological \u201Cimprovements\u201D
        often make emergency planning more rigid and increasingly inadequate.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-08T01:45:58Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-08T01:45:58Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1990</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/517</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        the Disaster Research Center (DRC) at the University of Delaware and social
        scientists associated with the Institute of Mass Communication and Journalism
        at the University of Tokyo in Japan undertook a joint research project on
        mass media reporting of news about disasters in both countries. Using a common
        although not identical research design, cooperatively developed ahead of time,
        the Americans studied local community-level reporting of a major hurricane
        (Hurricane Alicia in the Houston, Texas area in 1983) and a major sudden flood
        (around Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1984) while the Japanese concurrently researched
        the reporting of two similar disasters (floods around Nagasaki in 1982 and
        an earthquake in the Tohoku district in 1983) in their country. After the
        field data had been mostly analyzed, the researchers from both societies held
        a meeting in the United States to compare their findings.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-08T01:53:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-08T01:53:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1990</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/518</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        this paper three questions are addressed concerning possible differences and
        their implications for planning between natural and technological disasters.
        First, are disaster for planning purposes best approached generically or in
        agent specific terms? The mostly research based answer is  that the generic
        approach is more valid although this does not mean there are no meaningful
        differences along other dimensions between disasters. Thus, second, we ask
        along what lines disasters might be usefully differentiated or typologized?
        Eight key dimensions are discussed, mostly as they are significant for the
        emergency time phases of disaster occasions. Third, we conclude with asking
        whether whatever distinction are made, are they equally applicable across
        all phases of the disaster planning cycle, namely, mitigation or prevention,
        emergency preparedness, emergency response, and recovery? Our belief discussion
        takes the position that it appears the generic approach is clearly best applicable
        to the emergency times phases, somewhat less so for the mitigation phase with
        recovery falling in somewhat between the others. In the process of answering
        all three questions, implications for institutional and organizational behavior
        will be noted.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-08T02:01:40Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-08T02:01:40Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1990</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/519</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        of the very first research focus in the disaster area was the issuance of
        emergency warnings and the reactions to them (Williams, 1956; Fritz, 1961).
        \ This is understandable.  If there is warning of a threat, preventive, mitigatory,
        precautionary, and protective measures can be taken, including evacuation.
        \ Warnings can obviously be useful if not necessary for adaptive behavior
        to environmental changes\u2014natural or human created\u2014which put life,
        property, group routines, and the ecological balance in peril.  It is not
        surprising therefore that when social scientists started to do research on
        disasters about 35 years ago, many of the studies focused on the question
        of disaster warnings and how people and groups react to them.  This interest
        has continued to the present time (see several chapters in Dynes, DeMarchi
        and Pelanda, 1987).</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-08T20:37:50Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-08T20:37:50Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1990</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/520</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        in interdisciplinary conferences for several reasons.  Some of those disadvantages
        relate to the role which others perceive they should play and other disadvantages
        relate to style of presentation.  First, in reference to style, social scientists,
        in general, do not use slides and other visual imagery in their presentations.
        \ The reasons for this are not clear.  I have observed, however, that ineptness
        with slide projectors is rather universal and not discipline related.  But
        sides to provide a sense of \u201Chard\u201D reality to audiences when words
        seldom do.  Therefore, slides give the audience a sense of apparent truth
        which perhaps is not deserved.  I am not suggesting that pictures distort
        truth, although they can, but I am suggesting that they can capture well physical
        reality but reveal little of social reality.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-09T01:13:45Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-09T01:13:45Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1990</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/527</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        is important initially to provide a context for the discussion of mitigation
        that follows.  For many terms, there is a lack of standardization of meaning.
        \ For example, the term of \u201Chazard\u201D reduction is used primarily
        by those with specific interest in hazards per se.  Also, the term \u201Crisk\u201D
        reduction is often used as an equivalent term.  The preference here is to
        use the term \u201Cmitigation.\u201D Mitigation itself has become somewhat
        standardized as one of the four phase of disasters, including, besides mitigation,
        preparedness, response and recovery.  These phases are best seen as circular,
        rather than linear.  As some studies have suggested, the recovery period may
        be an appropriate time to initiate mitigation strategies.  The \u201Ccircular\u201D
        pattern of phases is a useful \u201Cmetaphor,\u201D even if the delineation
        of the phases is sometimes difficult.  For example, preparedness activities
        can be considered as one element of \u201Cmitigation.\u201D  Some of the studies
        mentioned later do discuss various preparedness measures, either at the personal
        or community level.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-09T22:29:08Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-09T22:29:08Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1991</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/535</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        successful earthquake prediction would be of great benefit to reduce social
        and economic losses in seismically threatened communities.  However, the impact
        of an earthquake prediction itself upon a community may be great; therefore,
        research on the social consequences of earthquake prediction is vitally important.
        \ The Tangshan earthquake of July 28, 1976 was not predicted by a short-term
        or imminent prediction which resulted in enormous loss of life and property
        damage occurred.  However, a mid-term prediction had been issued.  Using data
        from the social and economic survey on the Tangshan earthquake, public responses
        in Tianjin and Tangshan to this  mid-term earthquake prediction will be investigated
        in this paper.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-10</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-10</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1991</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/537</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        the first part of the paper we discuss how popular thinking, much disaster
        planning and some hazard research has tended to conceive of disasters in agent
        specific terms, that is , as hurricanes, chemical explosions, earthquakes,
        radiation fallouts, etc.  We question the value of such an approach with its
        emphasis on physical features of an event, and also challenge the frequently
        advanced distinctions drawn among and between so-called \u201CActs of God\u201D/
        natural disasters, and technological/human created disasters.  Instead the
        usefulness of thinking of disasters in generic or general rather than agent
        specific terms is suggested; in particular the value of conceiving of disasters
        as social phenomena is stressed.  We specially note how a generic approach
        which views disasters as social occasions rather that physical happenings
        has important implications for the preparing for and managing of such social
        occurrences.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-10T01:48:36Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-10T01:48:36Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1991</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/541</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        is a somewhat exotic field of study called the history and sociology of science.
        \ It basically try to describe and explain the factors that are involved in
        the initiation and growth of any area of organized study.  Among other findings,
        it has been discovered that there are some predictable stages in the development
        of concepts used in any scientific area.  Typically and particularly in a
        relatively new field of research, the earlier workers in the area, almost
        inevitably start out using everyday terms and labels to describe and explain
        whatever they are studying.  Then as the scientific field develops, certain
        distinctions begin to be made.  Certain phenomena which are put together by
        everyday labels are analytically pulled apart and given different labels,
        whereas other phenomena which are not treated under the same name by ordinary
        discourse are conversely put together in the scientific conceptualizations.
        \ Eventually, as the field matures, new and different from everyday terminology
        terms and labels are often created and used as major concepts in the area.
        \ In this last stage, both the names for the concepts and the phenomena being
        conceptualized are frequently rather different from the original everyday
        usages.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-10T02:39:23Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-10T02:39:23Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1991</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/542</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        than a \u201Cnatural\u201D happening.  Thus any effort at disaster reduction
        will involve planning and action by various social units.  The success of
        those efforts will depend on the adequacy of understanding that social base.
        \ The local community is taken as the primary focus of attention since that

        major factors inherent in the very structure of social life.  For one, disaster
        agents and occasions will almost certainly increase as a result of basic human
        and group characteristics.  In addition, because of certain social trends
        there will be changes in risks and vulnerabilities that will have unfavorable

        of disaster planning.  In fact, our view is just the opposite; any effective

        the earthquake threat, what can be done about it, and what capacity is needed
        to undertake remedial actions.  Both China and the United States have acquired
        some such understanding about their own societies.  However, they could learn
        from one another and speed up the process of planning relevant measures and
        implementing them, if joint and cooperative studies and research efforts were
        undertaken by social and other involved scientists from both societies.  We
        in the United States have already undertaken such studies with colleagues

        is sometime suggested in the disaster planning literature that rather than
        evacuating potential victims of a radiation fallout from a nuclear plant accident,
        they should instead be taught to take in-place sheltering.  This issue is
        examined with respect to such health care facilities as hospitals and nursing
        homes.  The focus is especially on the perceptions or social psychological
        factors that would be operative among the major social actors, namely the
        patients, their relatives, the staff members of the facilities, and other
        organizational personnel who would be involved in either of the two processes.
        \ The social science research literature on the matter collected at the Disaster
        Research Center was used to make an evaluation of the pros and cons of evacuating
        or sheltering.  The data strongly points to the strong probability that there
        are far more plus than minuses on planning for evacuation than in-place sheltering.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-11T19:46:09Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-11T19:46:09Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1992</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/561</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        consider the extent to which social science research findings about disasters
        primarily derived from developed countries can and should be applied in developing
        societies.  It is first noted that the conceptual distinction made between
        developed and developing social systems may lead to an underestimation of
        the existing capabilities for preparing for and responding to disasters in
        developing nations.  We then note general differences between organizational
        structures in developed and developing societies, because organizations everywhere
        are the prime actors in disaster preparedness and response.  However, most
        of the paper discusses six major observations with respect to the extent to
        which empirically based research findings about the behavior of organizations
        in highly urbanized and industrialized societies can be extrapolated to or
        applied in developing social systems.  We conclude that it is not a matter
        of either/or, and that there are certain social features in developing societies
        which might lessen the necessity of importing disaster social technology from
        developed countries.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-11T20:10:04Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-11T20:10:04Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1992</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/566</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Hurricane Andrew hit the mainland of the U.S., the eye hovered over the Federal
        Emergency Management Agency. FEMA became a convenient target for criticism.
        In addition to the national media coverage of the storm, local stations from
        across the country armed with new technology did their own \u201Cdamage assessment\u201D
        and neophyte reporters sought out delay and inefficiency. Accusation of inattention
        and incompetence in the early days after impact were constantly contrasted
        with the mobilization of last year\u2019s \u201Cdisaster,\u201D Desert Storm.
        That contrast suggested FEMA should have been there involved in rescue, providing
        hot meals and issuing checks for damaged roofs. Of course, a major disaster
        in a political year engenders controversy. When the Emergency Manager in Dade
        County, Kate Hale asked the question on TV on the evening of the day after
        impact \u201CWhere\u2019s the calvary?\u201D, the blame was placed on Washington.
        Soon after, President Bush appointed Secretary of Transporation Carr to \u201Ccoordinate\u201D
        the Federal response. All of these media impressions and conflicting images
        made it difficult to understand \u201Cwhat should have happened\u201D after
        Andrew.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-12T16:33:47Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-12T16:33:47Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1992</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/569</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        was important for a number of reasons. The interest here is the fact that
        this particular occasion became the focus of the first systematic social scientific
        study disaster. In October 1920, Samuel H. Prince published Catastrophe and
        Social Change, Based on a Sociological Study of the Halifax Disaster. That
        work was part of his Ph.D. work and the chair of his dissertation committee
        at Columbia University was F.H. Giddings. Since Giddings was a significant
        figure in the developing field of sociology, Prince\u2019s study can be placed

        and users of that research are identified. It is suggested that the most important
        policy use of disaster research has been to change the conceptualization of
        the disaster. While no specific study can be directly tied to particular policy
        changes, the overall research tradition has had a transforming effect. The
        transformation is, of course, more obvious in some societies than in others.&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\nIn
        the future, it is suggested that increased attention will be given to disaster
        preparedness and planning because of more and worse disasters. This means
        that social science research will continue to thrive because of its potential
        utility in problem solving. However, future research will be increasingly
        cast in interdisciplinary terms. Given the reluctance to support basic research,
        the relationship between applied research and the core disciplines will be

        conception of disaster, especially the attributed source of the occasion,

        certain sudden and extraordinary physical disturbances with significant negative
        effects as \u201CActs of God\u201D (even outside of Western Culture, a religious
        framework of a similar nature has been used). Whether it is volcanic eruptions
        or hurricanes/cyclones, the source of the disaster agent was seen as in the
        supernatural domain.&#13;\n&#13;\nIn more recent time, and with the spread
        of a more secular and nonreligious ideologies, there was a shift to the term
        \u201Cnatural\u201D disaster, substituting nature for the supernatural. So
        earthquakes are the result of plate dynamics, or floods the consequences of
        rainfall and drainage capabilities. But in either case the supernatural or
        nature, the imagery is that something external and beyond the realm of human
        victims was responsible for whatever happened.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-12T17:08:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-12T17:08:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1992</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/572</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        be a mistake to automatically assume that responses to disasters would significantly
        differ in developed and developing countries, the research done might give
        use some clues as to whether some differences might be attributable to the
        stages of development of the society involved. Under any circumstance, the
        work partly meets the argument of those who argue that crisis planning and
        managing in developing countries can be improved only by studying disasters
        in those kinds of societies (for some such research but almost all of a case

        1917 explosion in Halifax Harbor was important for a number of reasons, not
        the least of which was that particular tragedy became the focus of the first
        systematic social scientific study of disaster. In October 1920, Samuel H.
        Prince published \"Catastrophe and Social Change, Based on a Sociological
        Study of the Halifax Disaster,\"  which had been done as part of her Ph.D.
        work and the chair of his dissertation committee at Columbia University was
        F.H. Giddings, a significant figure in the developing field of sociology,
        Prince\u2019s study can be placed both within the context of sociological
        thought at the time as well as its place within the disaster research tradition
        which has evolved since his pioneering work.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-12T17:56:04Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-12T17:56:04Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1993</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/576</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Prieta Earthquake</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>One of the most costly and
        damaging disasters in U.S. history, the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake was the
        largest earthquake to strike California since 1952 and the most devastating
        to hit the San Francisco Bay Area since 1906.  From the earliest hours following
        impact, as initial reconnaissance efforts got under way, it was evident that
        Loma Prieta would become an important case study for the various disciplines
        concerned with earthquake hazard reduction.  Because Loma Prieta presented
        such an obvious opportunity to learn more about the earthquake hazard, an
        unprecedented number of studies were undertaken in the earth sciences, engineering,
        and the social science.  At this point, a little more that three years after
        the event, an enormous amount of data have been collected and a lot has been
        learned on a wide range of topics.  This paper focuses on the lessons for
        emergency preparedness and response that have resulted from that research.
        \ After presenting a brief overview of research on Loma Prieta, the paper
        considers research findings and practical implications related to the actions
        of individuals, households, and the public at large; groups and organizations,
        and government agencies and the intergovernmental system.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-12T19:16:33Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-12T19:16:33Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1993</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/578</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        central&#13;\nquestions: What can be conceptualized as a&#13;\ndisaster? What
        are important conditions that&#13;\ngenerate these occasions? What are major&#13;\nconsequences
        of disastrous occasions? In the first part of the paper we show that&#13;\nfrom
        a conceptual point of view, disastrous&#13;\noccasions are usefully dividable
        into&#13;\n\"disasters\" and \"catastrophes\". In particular&#13;\nwe note
        the quantitative and qualitative&#13;\ndifferences between both everyday emergencies&#13;\nand
        \"disasters\" as well as between \"disasters\"&#13;\nand \"catastrophes\".
        In the next part of the paper we extensively&#13;\ndiscuss important social
        factors or conditions&#13;\nwhich facilitate or generate disasters and&#13;\ncatastrophes.
        It is especially noted how&#13;\ndisastrous occasions are rooted before impact&#13;\nin
        the ongoing social developments or the&#13;\nsocial changes and trends already
        existing in&#13;\nsocieties. Such projected changes almost&#13;\nassure that
        in the future we will have more&#13;\nand worse disastrous occasions.&#13;\nThis
        part is followed by a briefer discussion&#13;\nof how disasters and catastrophes
        affect&#13;\nsocial development, especially at the macro level of societies.
        We especially note that&#13;\nthere is considerable differentiation in if,&#13;\nwhere,
        and how, disastrous occasions affect&#13;\nsocial change and development.
        The paper concludes with a short discussion of&#13;\nhow planning for disastrous
        occasions is also&#13;\nbeing positively affected by social changes.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-12T21:07:07Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-12T21:07:07Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1993</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/582</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        this paper we address what is important in preparing for and&#13;\nmanaging
        disaster occasions. Our starting point is that what is&#13;\ncrucial is not
        planning or managing, but good planning and&#13;\nmanaging. It is after all
        possible to have bad instances of both.&#13;\nThus, to assess in any intelligent

        Implications</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Developing Countries</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>As
        the developing world continues to industrialize and urbanize, it&#13;\nis
        continually creating conditions for more and worse disasters in&#13;\nthe
        future that will, among other things, contribute further to&#13;\nenvironmental
        degradation and hinder developmental programs. The&#13;\nprocesses of industrialization
        and urbanization, however positive&#13;\nin effects along certain lines, will
        both increase the number of&#13;\npotential disaster agents and enlarge the
        vulnerabilities of&#13;\ncommunities and populations that will be at risk.Making
        for an increase are: (1) the accelerating expansion of&#13;\naccidents and
        mishaps in the chemical and nuclear areas; (2)&#13;\ntechnological advances
        which reduce some hazards but make some old&#13;\nthreats more dangerous;
        (3) new versions of old and past dangers&#13;\nsuch as urban droughts; (4)
        the emergence of innovative kinds of&#13;\ntechnologies such as computers
        and biogenetics which present&#13;\ndistinctively new dangers; and, (5) an
        increase in multiple (e.g.&#13;\nnatural disasters creating technological
        ones) or synergistic type&#13;\ndisasters resulting in more severe environmental
        consequences. Increasing the vulnerabilities are that: (1) both natural and&#13;\ntechnological
        disaster agents will simply have more built-up areas&#13;\nto impact; (2)
        more vulnerable kinds of populations will be&#13;\nimpacted than in the past;
        (3) metropolitan areas will be&#13;\nincreasingly impacted and along certain
        lines the social&#13;\norganizations and group configurations of urban areas
        are not&#13;\nparticularly well suited for coping with disasters; (4) increasing&#13;\nlocalities
        will have disastrous conditions from sources that may be&#13;\nquite distant
        and even from the past; and (5) certain future&#13;\ndisasters have catastrophic
        potential even though they may produce&#13;\nno casualties nor do much property
        damage. Although there are a few countervailing trends, these two set of&#13;\nconditions
        will insure both quantatively more and qualitatively&#13;\nworse disasters
        in coming decades. Among the major implications&#13;\nare furtherance of environmental
        degradation, in some cases&#13;\npolluting some areas almost forever and creating
        problems for future generations. Projected future disasters will also slow
        down&#13;\nthe implementation of developmental programs and perhaps even the&#13;\nadoption
        of otherwise worthwhile technological innovations. will reduce and weaken
        some of the negative effects of the probable&#13;\ncatastrophic disasters
        of the future. Among major ones are: (1)&#13;\nnoting and accepting the fact
        that all disasters are essentially&#13;\nsocial occasions that primarily have
        to be dealt with by social&#13;\nmore than technological means; (2) eliminating
        the distinction in&#13;\nplanning between natural and technological disasters
        and moving to&#13;\nan all hazard or generic approach; (3) making disaster
        mitigation&#13;\nat least as much a priority in planning and application as&#13;\nemergency
        preparedness, response and recovery; (4) more closely&#13;\nintegrating disaster
        planning to the developmental planning or&#13;\nsocial change processes of
        the social system involved; and (5)&#13;\nascertaining in what ways disaster
        problems are similar to and&#13;\ndifferent from other environmental problems,
        and concurrently&#13;\naddressing both where there are similarities.&#13;\nIf
        the right policies and measures are put in place the future will&#13;\nnot
        be the past revisited nor will it be only the present repeated.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-12T22:13:35Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-12T22:13:35Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1994</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/585</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        studies of emergency response in disasters suggest that certain problem recur,
        regardless of location or timing. Among these recurrent problems are instances
        of too much assistance and/or the wrong kind of assistance. Too, that assistance
        is often delivered in inefficient and ineffective ways. Massive human and
        material resources produce convergence and lack of coordination. Among helping
        organizations, there is overlap as well as gaps in  service. Questions of
        equity in assistance are raised as well as the possibility of exploitation
        of victims while concern is expressed to avoid victim dependence. Efficient
        assistance is impeded by bureaucratic norms which lead to confusion and frustration.
        Bureaucratic organizations are seen as uncaring while caring organizations
        lack standards. While these issues are well known, they are often seen as
        quite solvable. For some, they indicate the necessity of preplanning. For
        others, they require the imposition of strong leadership. A less sanguine
        view is taken here in that these problems cannot be easily solved since they
        are part and parcel of the solution to disaster assistance which has emerged
        in industrial societies. The point of view here is that situational altruism
        produces a massive response of human and material resources to cope effectively
        with disaster. That response is, in many ways, very inefficient.&#13;\n&#13;\nUnderstanding
        that process of situational altruism provides basis for evaluating misplaced
        policy solutions as well as a basis for understanding how the process works
        as well as it does.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-13T18:22:02Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-13T18:22:02Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1994</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/586</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        of the most costly and damaging disasters in U.S. history, the 1989 Loma Prieta
        earthquake was the largest earthquake to strike California since 1952 and
        the most devastating to hit the San Francisco Bay Area since 1906. From the
        earliest hours following impact, as initial reconnaissance efforts got under
        way, it was evident that Loma Prieta would become an important case study
        for the various disciplines concerned with earthquake hazard reduction. Because
        Loma Prieta presented such an obvious opportunity to learn more about the
        earthquake hazard, an unprecedented number of studies were undertaken in the
        earth sciences, engineering, and the social sciences. At this point, a little
        more than three years after the event, an enormous amount of data have been
        collected and a lot has been learned on a wide range of topics. This paper
        focuses on the lessons for emergency preparedness and response that have resulted
        from that research. After presenting a brief overview of research on Loma
        Prieta, the paper considers research findings and practical implications related
        to the actions of individuals, households, and the public at large; groups
        and organizations; and government agencies and the intergovernmental system.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-13T18:31:28Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-13T18:31:28Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1994</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/587</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        in the police brutality trial of the officers charged with beating Rodney
        King was one of the most deadly and damaging episodes of civil unrest in U.S.
        history. Although estimates vary, a total of 51 deaths and over 2,000 injuries
        were attributed to the unrest (Koehler, et al, 1993). Approximately 20,000
        police, California Highway Patrol, National Guard, and military personnel
        were used to restore order in the Los Angeles City and County, and over 16,000
        people were arrested. The disturbances lasted a shorter time than the 1965
        Watts riot, but the geographic area covered was significantly larger, more
        people were killed and injured, more law enforcement personnel were mobilized,
        four times as many persons were arrested, and property damage was much greater.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-13T18:40:51Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-13T18:40:51Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1994</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/588</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        tend to accept in an uncritical way that theories and research findings on

        However, they should critically assess what these other disciplines take for
        granted, correct such biases as exist in the literature, and adopt a more
        distinctive sociological perspective on the topic of risk. More specifically,
        sociology can bring clarity to analyses of risk-related phenomena by studying
        in a systematic manner: how risk estimates are socially constructed, and how
        risk is socially produced. Sociologists are particularly qualified to show
        how social structural, organizational and institutional factors generate and

        the crisis time periods of disasters. It is noted that while emergent social
        phenomena has been observed by disaster researchers since the initial development
        of the field in the 1950s, the topic has not been systematically studied until
        recently. Building on an earlier sociologically grounded fourfold typology
        of organized behavior in disasters developed by the Disaster Research Center
        (DRC), the research we undertook focused on the full range of emergent social
        phenomena that could appear. The most important finding was that even in organizations
        and groups that were not emergent, there was nonetheless considerable behavioral
        emergence. This observation is used to develop a new typology of emergence
        that places emergent behaviors with the same analytical framework as emergent
        groups. Although our research focused on the characteristics of emergent phenomena,
        we also advance some general hypotheses about the social factors involved
        in emergence. Among final concluding remarks is the observation that although
        the sociological subfield of collective behavior has both informed and been
        informed by disaster research on emergence, an even stronger link would be
        desirable.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-13T19:11:25Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-13T19:11:25Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1994</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/591</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        system analysis of the most serious radiation accident after Chernobyl that
        occurred in the former secret town of Tomsk-7 in Siberia in Russia is presented.
        This is the first attempt in Russia, to the author\u2019s knowledge, to scrutinize
        the anatomy of an accident that fortunately did not develop into a great industrial
        crisis or even disaster. It is argued that the fundamental causes of the Tomsk-7
        accident are deeply rooted in the history of the economic and political development
        of the former Soviet Union in general, and the development policy of the nuclear
        complex for decades covered by secrecy and military orientation in particular.
        Those served as an environment for specific human, organizational and technological
        factors that directly facilitated the explosion. A description of the ecological,
        medical and sociopsychological aftermaths of Tomsk-7 accident as well as the
        related response and recovery activities is presented.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-13T19:43:10Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-13T19:43:10Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1994</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/592</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        note our comments are not based on the&#13;\nresults of any particular study,
        but instead are drawn from about&#13;\nfour decades of social science research
        starting in the late 1950s.&#13;\nThus, our knowledge data base includes literally
        at this point&#13;\nthousands of studies. Our Center alone, the Disaster Research&#13;\nCenter,
        has examined in the field more than 515 different disaster&#13;\nand crisis
        occasions. Also, while initially the work on disasters&#13;\nwas primarily
        undertaken in the United States, through the years it&#13;\nspread around
        the world so that at the present time there are about&#13;\nthree dozen different
        societies where there is at least a core of&#13;\nsocial science disaster
        researchers. Thus, the research results we&#13;\nuse are not exclusively rooted
        in American society. To be sure,&#13;\nthe studies done are somewhat slanted
        more towards developed than&#13;\ndeveloping societies and are more focused
        on sudden rather than&#13;\ndiffuse kinds of disaster situations, but many
        of the observations&#13;\nmade would appear to be rather generalizable.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-14</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-14</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1994</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/594</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        organizations as actors in modern&#13;\nurban communities is by now a well
        known fact. As Turk (1970)&#13;\nsuggests, modern society can be viewed as
        an aggregate of&#13;\norganizations which appear, disappear, change, merge,
        and form&#13;\nnetworks of relations with each other. This perspective provides&#13;\na
        useful tool for understanding how society responds to, and deals&#13;\nwith,
        environmental issues such as marine oil spills. Indeed, mass&#13;\nresponses
        to a broader setting are both formulated and enacted by&#13;\norganizations.
        Agencies, however, do not always coordinate and communicate to the extent
        necessary for the successful completion&#13;\nof their responsibilities. Unfortunately,
        it often takes a&#13;\ncatastrophic event to call this issue into question.
        For example,&#13;\non March 24, 1989 the Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh
        Reef&#13;\nspilling eleven million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William&#13;\nSound.
        Because of this event, the nation's concern for oil spills&#13;\nhas dramatically
        increased. One manifestation of this increased&#13;\nawareness was the creation
        of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990&#13;\nfOPA'90). A component of this legislation
        includes the&#13;\naugmentation of oil spill contingency planning in the nation.
        By&#13;\nmandating a more comprehensive state of planning, it is hoped that&#13;\nresponders
        will be more effective in their response to oil spills.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-14T01:50:14Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-14T01:50:14Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1994</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/597</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        management</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Our papers has five major parts in
        dealing with the general question: for planning and managing purposes to what
        extent can destructive and damaging situations as are occasioned by natural
        disasters, civil strife and riots, technological disasters, and ecological
        problems be viewed as essentially similar phenomena?&#13;\n&#13;\nIn the first
        part, we make a conceptual distinction between natural and technological disasters
        as consensus occasions and other crises that are of a conflictive nature.
        These two types of crises require somewhat different kinds of planning and
        managing, so conflict occasions are not further examined. Also, natural and
        technological disasters are distinguished from ecological problems on the
        basis of their sudden and crisis generating nature. While we look at ecological
        problems in the last part of the paper, most of our observations are about
        disasters.&#13;\n&#13;\nWe next indicate how popular thinking, much disaster
        planning and some hazard research has tended to conceive of sudden type disasters
        in agent specific terms, that is, as hurricanes, chemical explosions, earthquakes,
        radiation fallouts, etc. We question the value of such an approach with its
        emphasis on physical features of an event, and also challenge the frequently
        advanced distinctions drawn between so-called \u201CActs of God\u201D/natural
        disasters, and technological/human created disasters. Instead the usefulness
        of thinking of disasters in generic or general rather than agent specific
        terms is suggested; in particular the value of conceiving of disasters as
        social phenomena is stressed. We especially note how a generic approach which
        views disasters as social occasions rather than physical happenings has important
        implications for the preparing for and managing of such social occurrences.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-14T23:07:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-14T23:07:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1993</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/620</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        research program has examined factors that lead people to hold others responsible
        for disasters and their consequences. In scenario experiments, respondents
        read descriptions of communities that experienced technological or natural
        disasters, and made judgments about the responsibility of various actors for
        disaster planning and mitigation as well as for compensation for disaster-related
        damages.&#13;\n&#13;\nRespondents\u2019 judgments reflected strong desires
        for holding human actors responsible for disaster consequences. Attributed
        responsibility was substantial, even for natural disasters. Government officials,
        especially local officials, were perceived to be highly responsible for disaster
        mitigation and compensation for disaster losses. The perceived responsibilities
        of design professionals, scientists, businesses, and community residents varied
        with the type of disaster and the type of activity under consideration. The
        results indicate the usefulness of scenario methodology for understanding
        public judgments of responsibility for disaster consequences.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-14T23:54:53Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-14T23:54:53Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1994</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/624</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        recovery</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>community recovery</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>This
        paper takes the perspective that recovery from disaster is not merely concerned
        with the reestablishment of the physical or built environment; that is, community
        recovery should not be conceptualized as an outcome, but rather as a social
        process that begins before a disaster occurs and encompasses decision-making
        concerning emergency response, restoration, and reconstruction activities
        following the disaster. Put another way, reconstruction is less a technical
        problem than it is a social one. In order for successful post-disaster decisions
        to be made, however, there must be an awareness of the pre-disaster conditions
        that create situations of social and structural vulnerability, putting some
        segments of the society at greater risk in the event of an earthquake than
        others. From this perspective, what becomes important is how those decisions
        are made, who is involved in the decision-making, what consequences those
        decisions have on the social groups within the disaster-stricken communities,
        and who benefits from these decisions and who does not.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-15</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-15</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1995</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/625</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        standard, the Northridge earthquake was one of the most costly and damaging&#13;\ndisasters
        in U. S. history. When all the claims are finally processed, the costs of
        repairing&#13;\nearthquake damage and providing relief to victims are expected
        to exceed $20 billion. The&#13;\nassistance effort launched after the Northridge
        earthquake was the largest ever undertaken for a&#13;\nU. S. disaster; in
        the four month period following the earthquake, approximately 556,000&#13;\napplications
        for assistance were filed by community residents and business proprietors
        who&#13;\nsuffered earthquake-related losses. Up until that time, the previous
        high for applications received&#13;\nwas 304,000 for Humcane Hugo in 1989,
        which included victims in the states of North and South Carolina, Puerto Rico,
        and the U. S. Virgin Islands.&#13;\nThe number of disaster-related claims
        filed and the amounts disbursed through various&#13;\ndisaster assistance
        programs have been truly unprecedented. As of the end of October, 1994, the&#13;\nFederal
        Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had received 519,000 applications for disaster&#13;\nhousing
        assistance and had issued approximately 430,000 checks totaling $1.86 billion.&#13;\nApproximately
        179,600 households had applied to the U. S. Small Business Administration
        (SBA)&#13;\nfor loans to cover home repairs; of this number, about 88,300
        loans had been approved, and $2.2&#13;\nbillion in loan funds had been disbursed
        to homeowners. Nearly 300,000 households had applied&#13;\nfor FEMA's Individual
        and Family Grant program, which provides aid to households that do not&#13;\nqualify
        for disaster assistance loan programs. About 51,200 businesses had applied
        for SBA loans&#13;\nto cover direct earthquake damage or the losses associated
        with business interruption, and $1.32&#13;\nbillion in loans had been paid
        out. The earthquake did extensive damage to public buildings,&#13;\nroads
        and bridges, and water control facilities; as of the end of October, $1.86
        billion had been&#13;\nobligated to cover the cost of earthquake-related repairs
        to publicly-owned facilities.'</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-18T21:21:25Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-18T21:21:25Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1995</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/633</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        a contribution to the study of elementary collective behavior, this paper&#13;\nsummarizes
        our research on emergent behaviors and groups in the crisis time of&#13;\ndisasters.
        Although disaster researchers have observed emergent social phenomenon&#13;\nsince
        the initial development of the field in the 1950s, until recently there has
        not been&#13;\nsystematic study of the topic. In the 1960s, researchers at
        the Disaster Research&#13;\nCenter (DRC) developed a sociologically grounded
        fourfold typology of organized&#13;\nbehavior in disasters. Building on that
        work, we undertook to study the full range&#13;\nof possible emergent phenomenon.
        The most important finding by far was that even&#13;\nin organizations and
        groups that were not emergent, there was within them&#13;\nnonetheless considerable
        behavioral emergence. We use this observation to develop a new typology of
        emergence that places emergent behaviors within the same&#13;\nanalytical
        framework as emergent groups. Although our research focused on the&#13;\ncharacteristics
        of emergent phenomena, we also advance general hypotheses about the&#13;\nsocial
        factors involved in emergence. Among our concluding remarks is the&#13;\nobservation
        that although disaster research on emergence has both informed and been&#13;\ninformed
        by the sociological subfield of collective behavior, an even stronger link&#13;\nwould
        be desirable.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-18T21:31:33Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-18T21:31:33Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1995</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/634</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        While \"civil&#13;\nprotection\" is a term widely used in Europe, in many

        what might be characterized as major advances in new knowledge and understanding
        of disaster&#13;\nrelated phenomena. Certainly one would be hard pressed to
        point to the production of new theories,&#13;\nmodels, explanatory schemes
        and/or master hypotheses about the phenomena that are notably&#13;\ndifferent
        from what have been around for some time. In fact and worst, both relatively
        and&#13;\nabsolutely, little of the literature advances explicit theories,
        models, explanatory schemes and or master hypotheses of any kind. A partially
        completed informal content analysis of journals that publish disaster research
        articles in the social sciences support this contention.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-19T17:32:18Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-19T17:32:18Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1994</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/636</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        basic theme is a very simple one. The future is not the past repeated. This
        is as true in the&#13;\ndisaster area as anywhere else. If we are interested
        in what we will face by way of disasters to come, we cannot extrapolate only
        from the past.&#13;\nThis is important from a practical as well as a theoretical
        viewpoint. Research has consistently found that organizations and communities
        impacted by disasters, plan for future ones based on their last experience
        with such an occasion. Now it would seem reasonable to plan for the future

        Disaster Research Center surveys on disaster-related business impacts. The
        first study, conducted in 1994, focuses on the ways in which the 1993 Midwest&#13;\nfloods
        affected the operations of businesses in Des Moines/Polk County Iowa; the
        second project, which was recently completed, uses a similar methodological
        approach to assess the impacts of the 1994 Northridge earthquake on businesses
        in Los Angeles and Santa Monica, CA. Both studies utilize large representative
        samples that include both large and small firms and a range of business types.
        Topics discussed in the paper include physical damage to business properties;
        lifeline service interruption; rates of and reasons for&#13;\nbusiness closure
        and relocation; use of insurance, Small Business Administration loans, and
        other sources of disaster recovery assistance; and proprietors' assessments
        of business recovery and&#13;\nwell-being at the time the surveys were conducted.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-19T17:53:44Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-19T17:53:44Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1995</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/638</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        in three crowd events, focusing on the continuity of conventional gender roles.
        This focus allows us to address the relationship between institutionalized
        and collective behavior, suggesting limitations&#13;\nof the \"extra-institutionall'
        model of collective behavior. Social contagion approaches to collective behavior,
        focusing on its extrainstitutional&#13;\nquality, suggest that these forms
        of behavior&#13;\nrepresent distinct departures from nstitutionalized behavior.
        In contrast, more recent collective behavior scholarship, for example the
        emergent norm and emergent social structure approaches,&#13;\ncharacterize
        collective and institutionalized behavior as continuous.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-19T17:58:29Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-19T17:58:29Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1995</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/639</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        is just a few years that emergency management has been discussed within the
        policy setting as an important hetion of government. For long time the \"emergency
        issue\" - the occuring of natural and man-made hazardous events that strike
        human life, property, and safety - had been faced with a \"crisis-reactive\"
        management approach' that would portray emergency as an exceptional contingency
        and provide an improvised response to the calamitous event when would occur.
        Recently a new conception of emergency management has developed, supported
        both by the findings of twenty years of disaster research and by a wider social
        awareness of the multitude of risks that modem society has to face nowadays.This
        new conception is based on a \"problem solving\" approach that implies day-to-day
        planning and activities4. This approach emphasizes those aspects of mitigation
        and preparedness that aim at preventing disastrous emergencies either by reducing
        the degree of risk or by developing capabilities to provide effective response
        to emergency.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-19T18:05:45Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-19T18:05:45Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1995</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/640</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Impact Of Disaster On The Public And Their Expections</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Dynes,
        Russell R.</dc:creator>\n<dc:subject>Community Disaster</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Public</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Although
        the title is overarching, I need to delimit. While it is conventional to talk
        about&#13;\nseveral disaster phases--preparedness, response, recovery and
        mitigation, the focus here is primarily&#13;\non response. Too, I will focus
        on community disaster--where there is a sudden and major disruption&#13;\nof
        an urban area as a result of some natural or technological agents that threatens
        and/or impacts life,&#13;\nproperty and social routines. Community disasters
        are in contrast to accidents as well as, in contrast,&#13;\nto those rare
        catastrophic occasions which extend far beyond the normal routines of a single&#13;\ncommunity.
        The \"publics\" here will be based on studies of individual and organizational
        behavior&#13;\nwhich provide some grounds for generalization.The paper will
        make several inter-related points. For most Americans, concerns for risk and&#13;\nhazard
        have a very low salience. Disasters are not everyday worries for either citizens
        or public&#13;\nofficials. This is true even for those who live in areas characterized
        by \"objectively\" high risk. In&#13;\naddition, citizens see themselves as
        having little responsibility for the consequences of disaster but&#13;\ngive
        governmental units, especially local ones, greater responsibility. Among citizens,
        actual disaster experience is relatively rare, even cumulated over a lifetime.&#13;\nHowever,
        they have opinions about what disaster is like, drawn primarily from various
        media. Those&#13;\nrepetitive pictures suggest that individual \"victims\"
        do not cope well with disasters. Victims are\"stunned\" and traumatized and
        that local organizations are disrupted and paralyzed. So, individual&#13;\nand
        social disorganization are combined to create image of widespread helplessness
        in context of&#13;\nother overwhelming problems.&#13;\nThe paper will argue
        that these disaster myths are not supported by extensive research on&#13;\nbehavior
        in communities experiencing disaster impact. These myths, however false, still
        have social&#13;\nconsequences. The paper concludes in detailing how the myths
        affect both disaster planning and emergency response.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-19T20:34:03Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-19T20:34:03Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1995</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/642</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Nuclear Regulatory Commission</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>This paper attempts
        to show that while environmental shocks can lead to major&#13;\ninstitutional
        change, typically this change is not radical. Even in situations of&#13;\ninstitutional
        breakdown, due to violent and disruptive events such as disasters, it is&#13;\npossible
        to find institutional persistence which constraints and shapes the process
        of&#13;\nchange. In this sense, the paper portrays institutional change and
        institutional&#13;\npersistence more as coexisting than as contrasting.&#13;\nFocusing
        on the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island (1979), which \"ended the first&#13;\nnuclear
        era in the U.S. ( Weinberg, 1985: 1) \"divided nuclear power history in two&#13;\nparts--before
        and after Three Mile Island (Rees, 1994: l), the paper examines forms&#13;\nof
        major institutional change that originated from it, but have also revealed
        themselves&#13;\nas consistent with institutional persistence. A new path
        in nuclear safety regulation&#13;\ndeveloped near the accident at Three Mile
        Island (TMI). Yet, this new path has been&#13;\nconsistent with an old path
        in nuclear safety regulation that TMI did not break down,&#13;\nand to a certain
        extent strengthened. Emphasizing institutional persistence, the paper takes
        a historical perspective, paying&#13;\nattention both to the long-term institutional
        implications of the nuclear plant accident&#13;\nat TMI, and to its historical
        roots. History represents a basic framework for&#13;\nunderstanding the kind
        of institutional transformation developed in nuclear safety&#13;\nregulation
        after TMI. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is the main institution
        we&#13;\ninvestigate in this paper. The NRC is a case of institutional continuity
        in itself. It was&#13;\nestablished in 1974, but it inherited its structure,
        staff and regulatory system from its&#13;\npredecessor, the Atomic Energy
        Commission (AEC) established in 1946. The paper&#13;\nlooks at the process
        of the NRC's transformation that developed because of TMI.&#13;\nThat transformation
        has been constrained and mediated by the AEC's institutional&#13;\nlegacy.&#13;\nA
        second institution we focus on is nuclear safety regulation. The whole concept
        of nuclear safety, its culture and approach have changed because of TMI. The
        main institutional breakdown that TMI produced was precisely in the body of
        assumptions,&#13;\nvalues, rules and procedures which had guided nuclear safety
        regulation until then.&#13;\nThe paper then describes and analyzes the main
        changes which took place in the institutional&#13;\nenvironment of the NRC
        as a result of TMI. More specifically, the paper focuses on the&#13;\nInstitute
        for Nuclear Power Operations (INPO), the private regulatory agency set up
        by the&#13;\nnuclear industry in the afermath of TMI, and on its partnership
        with the NRC. The INPO&#13;\nitself, and especially the partnership between
        INPO and NRC, represent a major&#13;\ninstitutional change in nuclear safety
        regulation. This change also built upon persistent&#13;\ninstitutional arrangements
        which originated in the early days of nuclear power development.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-19T21:17:11Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-19T21:17:11Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1995</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/644</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Impacts Of The Northridge Earthquake</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Tierney, Kathleen
        J.</dc:creator>\n<dc:subject>Northridge Earthquake</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Los
        Angeles</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Santa Monica</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>The
        Northridge earthquake of January 17, 1994 killed 57 people&#13;\nand injured
        an estimated 10,000. When all the claims are finally&#13;\nprocessed, the
        costs of repairing earthquake damage and providing&#13;\nrelief to victims
        will probably exceed $30 billion, including $12-&#13;\n15 billion in insured
        losses, making that event the most costly&#13;\ndisaster in U. S. history.
        The number of households and businesses&#13;\nthat suffered losses in the
        Northridge earthquake far exceeded the&#13;\nsize of the victim population
        in other recent major disasters in&#13;\nthe U. S., including Hurricane Hugo
        in 1989 and Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The assistance effort launched after
        the earthquake was the&#13;\nlargest ever undertaken for a U. S. disaster.
        Applications to the&#13;\nFederal Emergency Management Agency for various
        forms of housing&#13;\nassistance totaled well over half a million. In the
        year following&#13;\nthe earthquake, over 50,000 businesses applied to the
        U. S. Small&#13;\nBusiness Administration for disaster loans, and over $1.3
        billion&#13;\nin loans had been paid out. This paper focuses on the immediate
        and longer-term impacts&#13;\nthe earthquake had on businesses in the Greater
        Los Angeles region.&#13;\nThe data reported here are based on a survey that
        the Disaster&#13;\nResearch Center conducted with a representative, randomly-selected&#13;\nsample
        of businesses in the cities of Los Angeles and Santa Monica, two jurisdictions
        that were particularly hard-hit in the&#13;\nearthquake. The paper discusses
        the direct impacts and losses&#13;\nbusinesses experienced in the earthquake;
        the ways in which the&#13;\ndisaster affected the operations of the businesses
        studied,&#13;\nincluding patterns of business interruption; earthquake&#13;\npreparedness
        measures undertaken by businesses, both prior to and&#13;\nafter the disaster;
        and business recovery one-and-a-half years&#13;\nafter the event.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-19T21:26:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-19T21:26:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1996</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/645</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        costly, damaging earthquake in the history of the United States. Over 11,800
        people received hospital treatment for earthquake-related injuries in the&#13;\nthree-county
        area shaken by the quake--Los Angeles, Ventura, and Orange--and 57 people
        died. Approximately 114,039 structures were&#13;\ndamaged by the quake, 14,500
        receiving either a red or yellow tag from building inspectors. These damaged
        structures contained over 100,000 housing units; 30,000 of which were vacated
        or had&#13;\nsignificant structural damage, and another 30,000 were deemed
        at risk of being removed from the building stock because of the expense of
        repairs (Comerio 1995). According to estimates from the&#13;\nGovernor's Office
        of Emergency Services (OES) in January, 1996, approximately $25 billion in
        losses due to damaged structures and their contents had occurred5. FEMA set
        aside over $12 billion to&#13;\nbe used for claims for all types of assistance
        to disaster victims and communities. As of December, 1995, 681,710 applications
        for state and federal assistance had been received, more than double&#13;\nthe
        amount in any previous single U.S. disaster. The previous record for applications
        was 304,369 following Hurricane Hugo which struck the Carolinas, Puerto Rico
        and the Virgin Islands in 1989.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-20T19:31:43Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-20T19:31:43Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1997</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/647</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        this paper we discuss what is important in the local managing of disasters
        We contrast this with the related but different process of planning for disaster
        occasions. Our assumption is that what is crucial is not management per se,
        but good managing. Thus, to assess in any intelligent way the management of
        community disasters requires&#13;\nanswering the question: what is good managing?
        The results of the empirical research undertaken by social scientists over
        what is now a 40 year period, are used for this purpose. The criteria discussed
        have to do with: (1) correctly recognizing differences between response and
        agent generated demands; (2)adequately carrying out generic functions; (3)
        effectively mobilizing&#13;\npersonnel and resources; (4) generating an appropriate
        delegation of tasks and a division of labor; (5) adequately processing information;&#13;\n(6)
        properly exercising decision making; (7) developing over all coordination;
        (8) blending emergent and established organizational&#13;\nbehaviors; (9)
        providing appropriate reports for the news media; and (10) having a well functioning
        emergency operations center. Also raised is the applicability of these research
        findings derived&#13;\nmostly from developed countries to developing societies.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-20T20:53:45Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-20T20:53:45Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1996</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/649</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        the long-term effects of disasters and the factors that affect the ability
        to recover have&#13;\nreceived increasing attention from social science researchers,
        little systematic research has been&#13;\nconducted on the processes and outcomes
        associated with business disaster recovery. This paper&#13;\nattempts to fill
        that void by exploring the determinants of recovery within the private sector.
        We develop a model of business recovery by drawing from existing research
        on disaster recovery and on&#13;\norganizational survival in non-disaster
        contexts, and test it using data collected from a stratified&#13;\nrandom
        sample of 1110 Los Angeles area firms affected by the 1994 Northridge earthquake.&#13;\nBusiness
        size, disruption of busiiess operations due to the earthquake, earthquake
        shaking intensity, and the utilization of external post-disaster aid are all
        predictors of business recovery. Size helps businesses weather disaster losses,
        just as it proves advantageous in non-disaster contexts. How businesses fare
        following disasters depends not only on direct physical impacts, but also
        on how disasters subsequently affect business operations as well as on ecological
        and neighborhood-level impacts. The aid available to businesses following
        disasters not only doesn\u2019t appear to help them recover; it may actually
        create additional problems, such as higher debt.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-20T20:58:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-20T20:58:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1996</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/650</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        recovery</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Northridge earthquake</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>While
        the long-term effects of disaster and the factors that affect the ability
        to recover have received increasing attention by social science researchers,
        the majority of research to date has taken families and households as the
        units&#13;\nof analysis, with a smaller number of studies focusing on the
        recovery of entire communities. The processes and outcomes associated with
        the recovery of private firms, however, have almost never been addressed in
        the literature. Studies of the long-term economic consequences of disasters
        have generally focused on aggregate community effects.&#13;\nFindings of this
        research suggest that disasters produce negligible impacts at the community
        level. While important, this type of research neglects the impacts of disasters
        on individual firms and overlooks important micro-level recovery processes.
        For example, empirical support exists for the notion that disasters create
        both winners and losers, a process that aggregate analyses cannot capture.
        With this in mind, this paper explores the distributive effects of disaster
        on 1110 Los Angeles area firms impacted by the 1994 Northridge earthquake.
        The model used to predict winners and losers is based on an earlier analysis
        of business recovery following the earthquake, studies of both&#13;\nhousehold
        and business disaster recovery, and the literature on organizational survival
        in non-disaster contexts. Findings show that business size, fmancial condition,
        disruption of business operations, earthquake shaking intensity,&#13;\nand
        the utilization of post-disaster aid are significant predictors of being worse
        off 18 months after the earthquake. Only financial condition was a significant
        predictor of being better off. Policy, theory, and future research implications
        are discussed.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-20T21:15:29Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-20T21:15:29Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1996</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/651</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        I am&#13;\nnever sure that such ritual occasions are organized to point to
        the future or to recall the past. As&#13;\nrecollections, one cannot fail
        to be impressed with the cumulative progress of the past 25 years.&#13;\nIn
        contrast with the first assessment, which was more theoretical and perhaps

        Response</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>societal impacts</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>emergency</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>The
        social science literature on emergency response activities following major
        disasters, which now spans&#13;\napproximately fifty years of empirical research,
        encompasses a wide range of topics (for reviews and&#13;\nrepresentative work,
        see Drabek, 1986; Drabek and Hoetmer, 1991; Dynes and Tierney, 1994). Those
        topics include: 1. Immediate societal impacts: disaster-related deaths and
        injuries and the factors associated with&#13;\nmortality and morbidity; housing
        impacts and the need for emergency shelter and temporary&#13;\nhousing; secondary
        impacts, such as fires and hazardous materials releases; and impacts on&#13;\nbusinesses
        and economic activity. Studies also focus on the factors associated with differential&#13;\nlevels
        of disaster vulnerability, such as poverty, substandard and overcrowded housing,
        and risk&#13;\nfactors for death and injury. 2. Organizational, interorganizational,
        and intergovernmental communication and coordination&#13;\nduring the emergency
        response period: how responding organizations and levels of government&#13;\ngather,
        share, and use disaster-related information, establish response priorities,
        and develop&#13;\nand carry out procedures for mobilizing resources and addressing
        the problems they encounter&#13;\nduring the emergency period. 3. The performance
        of key emergency tasks: the actions different social units and organizational&#13;\nentities
        (individuals, households, groups, organizations, and interorganizational and&#13;\nintergovernmental
        networks) undertake in order to deal with disaster-generated problems. Such&#13;\nactivities
        include rescuing victims and recovering bodies, providing emergency medical
        care,&#13;\nassessing damage, providing emergency shelter and temporary housing,
        and containing&#13;\nsecondary hazards. The literature also includes studies
        on the emergency activities of crisis-relevant&#13;\norganizations such as
        fire departments, emergency management agencies, search and&#13;\nrescue units,
        and hospitals. 4. Response by the general public during the emergency period:
        post-disaster behaviors and&#13;\nactivities of community residents, including
        behavior during and immediately after disaster&#13;\nimpact (warning response,
        self-protective actions, occupant behavior, evacuation, etc.), use of&#13;\nemergency
        shelter, public involvement community response activities, and volunteer behavior.
        5. Utilization of post-disaster emerpency and short-term recovery resources
        by disaster victims:&#13;\npatterns in the public's use of disaster-related
        services, such as emergency shelter, emergency&#13;\nmedical care, crisis
        counseling, and disaster assistance, as well as the factors that influence
        service utilization. 6. Crisis-related organizationnal adaptation and innovation:
        the ways in which various social units&#13;\nattempt to adapt and change in
        response to crisis-related demands. These patterns include expansion, in which
        existing organizations by to improve their performance by taking on new members
        or volunteers; extension, in which existing organizations assume new tasks
        they had&#13;\nnot performed prior to the disaster; and emergence, which involves
        the formation of new groups&#13;\nand intergroup netwok. Modes of adaptation
        can also include improvising new strategies for&#13;\nhanding disaster-related
        problems, introducing new technologies, and identifying previously&#13;\nuntapped
        resources. 7. Factors that affect the nature, extent, and effectiveness of
        response activities: For individuals&#13;\nand households, such factors have
        been shown to include socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity,&#13;\ndisaster
        knowledge, social networks, the extent of pre-disaster preparedness, and previous&#13;\ndisaster
        experience. Influences on the response activities of organizations and governmental&#13;\nentities
        include the extent and quality of pre-disaster planning and training, prior
        disaster&#13;\nexperience, disaster severity, the principles or assumptions
        on which response planning is&#13;\nbased, the resources that organizations
        have been able to devote to planning for and responding&#13;\nto disasters,
        access to needed technology and resources, and their ability to resolve&#13;\ninterorganizational
        and intergovernmental conflicts during the emergency period.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T01:03:55Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T01:03:55Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1997</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/655</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        disasters are considered more important than others with similar impacts.&#13;\nThe
        meaning of a particular disaster occasion is created independent of its consequences.&#13;\nWhere
        there are significant inconsistencies between the impact and the meaning&#13;\nassociated
        with it should be of interest to the social sciences. \"The focus here is
        the Lisbon&#13;\nearthquake, Nov. 1,1755, which can be considered the First
        \"modern\" disaster. It evoked&#13;\na coordinated state emergency response
        as well as a forward looking comprehensive plan&#13;\nfor reconstruction which
        included mitigation efforts to reduce future disaster effects. Of particular
        interest here are the circumstances which led to the earthquake being&#13;\nattributed
        to \"natural\" rather than \"supernatural\" causes. Prior to that, earthquakes&#13;\ntraditionally
        had been interpreted as a dramatic means of communication between gods&#13;\nand
        humans. In particular, such events previously had been explained as indicating
        some&#13;\ndisturbance between earthly and heavenly spheres. The Lisbon earthquake
        can be&#13;\nidentified as a turning point in human history which moved the
        consideration of such&#13;\nphysical events as supernatural signals toward
        a more neutral or even a secular, protoscientific&#13;\ncausation.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T01:11:30Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T01:11:30Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1997</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/656</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        ways in which private businesses are affected by and attempt to recover from
        earthquakes and other&#13;\ndisasters have seldom been addressed empirically.
        Research findings on the business impacts of disasters have&#13;\ngenerally
        been based on data from individual case studies or from a limited number of
        firms, rather than on&#13;\nlarge-scale surveys, and studies have tended to
        use purposive or convenience samples, rather than&#13;\nsystematically selected
        ones. Over the past few years, however, the Disaster Research Center has been
        carrying&#13;\nout a program of research on businesses and hazards that has
        included large-scale studies on such topics as&#13;\nSmall Business Administraton
        loan decision making following the Whittier Narrows earthquake (Dahlhamer,&#13;\n1992);
        disaster preparedness (Tierney and Dahlhamer, 1995; Dahlhamer and D'Souza,
        forthcoming, 1997);&#13;\nbusiness impacts and recovery following the 1993
        Midwest floods (Tierney, Nigg, and Dahlhamer, 1996); and&#13;\nbusiness vulnerability
        to disaster-induced lifeline service interruption (Tierney and Nigg, 1995).
        Because of&#13;\nits scope and severity, the Northridge event provided an

        in the United States. In particular, the Continental Illinois Bank Crises,
        the&#13;\nOhio Savings and Loan Crises, and the Stock Market Crises of 1987
        are examined. The case&#13;\nstudies allows the consideration of those events

        disaster</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Disasters are usually identified as
        having occurred at a particular time and place but they also occur at a particular
        time in human history and within a specific social and cultural context. Consequently,
        it is appropriate to call the Lisbon earthquake the first modern disaster
        (Dynes, 1999). Certainly, earlier history records many instances of geophysical
        events and the differences among such events were explained by variations
        in their physical intensity. But the Lisbon earthquake occurred at a time
        and a place which made it a part of the debate over modernity. Its location
        in Europe made it a topic in the intellectual debates of the times. These
        debates had greater impact on the changing cultural context than the physical
        intensity of the earthquake might&#13;\nimply. It happened when there were
        many strains between tradition and new ideas about progress. It was a time
        when traditional ideas and institutions were being challenged. It was a time
        when nation states were being created and when rivalries among states led
        to tensions and conflict. It was a time when the bonds of traditional religious
        authority were being challenged by a growing enthusiasm for intellectual freedom
        and for reason.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T22:44:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T22:44:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1998</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/661</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        scholars whose intellectual contributions have profoundly shaped the area
        known as the sociology of disasters. With the theme of honoring their contributions
        in mind, I have two objectives in this paper: first, to use one facet of my
        own research as a specific example of how Dynes and Quarantelli\u2019s early
        contributions continue to be useful in framing research questions today; and
        second, to talk more generally about what I see as some of their more important
        lasting contributions to the field of disaster research and the broader discipline
        of sociology. My treatment of these two topics will necessarily be selective
        and somewhat brief, as it would be impossible to cover in one short paper
        the full range of impacts these two prolific scholars have had on the development
        of the field\u2019. Nevertheless, it is my hope that these remarks will in
        some small way demonstrate the continuing value of Dynes and Quarantelli\u2019s
        lifelong work.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T22:50:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T22:50:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1999</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/662</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        political boundaries, however, emergency management is usually organized by
        political jurisdiction. This presents significant challenges to coordinating
        an effective response on a regional basis. It is usually difficult&#13;\nenough
        to coordinate activities between local jurisdictions, but when an international
        border is involved, the challenge may become even greater. Our August Workshop
        looked at some of these issues.&#13;\n&#13;\nFirst, Tricia Wachtendorf, a
        Manitoba resident and doctoral candidate at the University of Delaware shared
        her research findings from her recently completed study \"A River Runs Through
        It: Cross-Border Interaction During The 1997 Red River Flood.\"&#13;\n&#13;\nThe
        second half of the workshop, Cheryl Moate, Acting Executive Coordinator for
        the Manitoba Emergency Management Organization, introduced an institutional
        framework for&#13;\naddressing these issues, the Prairie Regional Emergency
        Management Advisory Committee (PREMAC), organized under a bilateral agreement
        between the two nations.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T22:59:03Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T22:59:03Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1999</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/663</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        costs of natural disasters, there has recently been a dramatic increase in
        the number of studies aimed at estimating financial losses caused by large-scale
        earthquakes. For example, in 1997 the journal Earthquake Spectra devoted an
        entire issue to this topic. Papers appearing in the special issue ranged from
        cost-benefit analyses of structural rehabilitation strategies (D'Ayala et
        al., 1997) to the development of real-time damage assessment tools Pguchi
        et al. 1997). In 1998 the Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake &#13;\nEngineering
        Research published a monograph addressing the engineering and socioeconomic&#13;\nimpacts
        of earthquakes (Shinozuka, Rose, and Eguchi, 1998). A primary focus of the
        report was&#13;\non the regional economic impacts of earthquake-induced electricity
        lifeline disruptions. More&#13;\nrecently, in 1999 the National Research Council
        Committee on Assessing the Costs of Natural&#13;\nDisasters published a report
        outlining a framework for loss estimation (National Research Council, 1999).
        The Committee's primary goals were to develop a framework for consistent and
        systematic collection of loss data from natural disasters and to build an
        institutional capacity for collecting such data.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T23:06:10Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T23:06:10Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1999</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/664</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        on August 17, 1999 was a major disaster. Measuring 7.4 on the Richter scale,
        the earthquake was centered near the cities of Izmit, Golcuk, and Adapazari.
        It damaged or destroyed as many as 100,000 buildings, left hundreds of thousands
        of people homeless, and, according to official estimates, resulted in the
        deaths of nearly 16,000 people. The earthquake also had a major impact on
        large industrial facilities in the region, and estimates of its economic impacts
        vary between 5 billion and 10 billion U.S. dollars. While preliminary estimates
        of the economic costs associated with the earthquake vary widely, actual costs
        will likely be substantial given the sheer magnitude of the event. Because
        the earthquake occurred in a largely urban and industrialized area, it resulted
        in widespread physical damage and severe social and economic disruptions.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T23:12:07Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T23:12:07Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1999</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/665</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        on archival data from the Disaster Research Center, this paper presents an
        empirically derived classification of the various ways key responders to natural
        disasters, technological crises, and civil disturbances improvise their role
        performances during the emergency response period. Five types of role improvising
        are identified: procedural changes, status changes, normative-order changes,
        equipment changes, and location/facility changes. T-test and crosstabs are
        used to examine the relationship between type of disaster event and type of
        role improvising, and intraclass correlation coefficients are used to assess
        the inter-rater reliability of the classification scheme. The paper concludes
        by discussing the implications of the classification scheme for future studies
        of role improvising in both routine and non-routine social settings and for
        the practice of emergency management.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T23:26:00Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T23:26:00Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1999</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/666</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        of 241 residents of southern Dade County, Florida were assessed 6 and 30 months
        after Hurricane Andrew. Percentages meeting study criteria for depression
        and PTSD did not change over time. Whereas mean levels of intrusion and arousal
        decreased, depressive symptoms remained stable, and avoidance/numbing symptoms
        actually increased. Intrusion and arousal were associated more strongly with
        pre-disaster factors (gender. ethnicity) and within-disaster factors (injury,
        property loss) than with post-disaster factors (stress, resources), but the
        reverse was true for depression and avoidance. Changes over time in symptoms
        were largely explained by changes over time in stress and resources. The study
        implies that ongoing services are needed to supplement the crisis-oriented
        assistance typically offered to disaster victims.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T23:38:53Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-21T23:38:53Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1999</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/667</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        have paid increasing attention to the impacts of disasters on the private
        sector, little is currently known about how disasters affect the long-term
        economic viability of businesses. Most studies of disaster recovery have taken
        either households or entire communities as the unit of analysis (Bolin 1982;
        Bolin and Bolton 1986; Rubin 1981; Rubin, Saperstein, and Barbee 1985), and
        those that have looked at the economic impacts of disasters tend to focus
        on large levels of aggregation, such as regional economies, rather than on
        individual firms (Albala-Bertrand 1993; Cohen 1993; 1995; Friesema et al.
        1979; Rossi et al.&#13;\n1978; West and Lenze 1994). When researchers have
        studied how disasters affect individual&#13;\nbusinesses and economic activity,
        they have generally focused on short-term impacts, rather than the longer-term
        consequences of disaster victimization (Alesch et al. 1993; Gordon et al.
        1995). Thus, it is not currently known whether disasters have any discernible
        longer-term consequences for individual businesses.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-22</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-22</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1999</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/668</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        I agreed to participate in this panel on disasters and popular culture, I
        did so with&#13;\nthe anticipation that in the several months I would have
        to prepare, I would have some bright idea. I recall I did have a bright idea
        several months ago, but I forgot what it was. It obviously was not that bright.
        As time moved on, I became quite desperate since I did not think it appropriate
        to present a paper without an idea in it. Then it occurred to me that I might
        utilize ideas from books I was reading since authors who write books should
        have ideas. (Having authored several books, I do know that is a questionable
        but hopeful assumption) In any case, I&#13;\ndid try to exploit others to
        give me ideas about the possibilities of disaster and popular culture.&#13;\nThe
        first book I will mention is Hans Blumenberg. Shipwreck with Spectator:, Paradigm
        of a Metaphor for Existence, (Cambridge, The MIT Press, 1997) Blumenberg,
        a German social theorist, has written extensively on myth and I had picked
        it up several times to read. He has a rather interesting argument. He argues
        that, in every culture, what escapes reality, life and history is handed over
        to long term work on images. And that one of the very persistent models is
        life as a sea voyage. \"It encompasses the voyage out and the voyage home,
        the harbor and the foreign shore, anchorage and sailing the seas, storm and
        calm, distress at sea and shipwreck, barely surviving and merely looking on.\"

        a sample of 727 residents of Alameda County CA.  The goals of the study were
        to obtain data on public perceptions of likely damage and disruption following
        a Bay Area earthquake, judgments concerning the criticality of various elements
        in the built environment, and willingness to pay for programs to strengthen
        structures and lifelines. Alameda County residents expect significant damage
        in the event of a major earthquake, and they have clear priorities regarding
        which structures and systems must remain operational should an earthquake
        occur. Most residents are willing to invest additional funds in seismic safety
        programs particularly programs targeting health- and safety-related structures,
        such as major hospitals, fire stations, and critical government buildings.
        Logistic regression analyses identified a number of predictors of support
        for seismic safety programs. The most significant predictors of overall willingness
        to pay for seismic upgrading were education age (which was negatively associated
        with willingness to pay), trust in California state government, household
        preparedness, and earthquake risk perception.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-22</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-22</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2000</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/670</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        themselves, they do not come out of a void, suddenly appearing. The evolution
        is always rooted in past and present conditions. This is true of social crises.
        We can grant that many crises which have been projected to appear in the 21st
        Century by many scholars and researchers as well as our self, wilt, differ
        in significant ways from those the world faced in the Century (for examples,
        see many of the articles&#13;\nin this very volume in which this paper will
        appear; see also, Quarantelli 1996, 19%). They will be different in important
        aspects from past and present crises. Nevertheless, those newer crises that
        are starting to appear in fuller and fuller form, can be seen to have predecessors
        of some kind in the past and in the present. There is not and could not be
        a sudden transformation of the characteristics of older crises into the features
        of the newer social crises.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-22</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-22</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2000</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/671</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        disaster</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>While the focus here will be on the
        development of governmental systems for disaster management, it is appropriate
        to provide some initial remarks about the rather confusing concepts of \u201Cdisaster.\u201D
        It has many different meanings in popular discourse. A number of years ago,
        (Dynes, 1974), I noted at least four different meanings: (a) the designation
        of a disaster agent, such as a flood or an earthquake; (b) the indicator of
        physical damage, such as a hundred houses destroyed; (c) an indicator of social
        damage, the uprooting of family living or the destruction of family relationships
        and (d) an indicator of a negative evaluation, such as a failed culinary effort
        or a troublesome friend. Unfortunately, these different meanings have little
        consistent  relationship among them. Even considerable physical damage does
        not automatically translate into social damage. This can be illustrated by
        the 1988 earthquake in Armenia. That earthquake, 6.9 on the Richter Scale,
        killed approximately 25,000, injured more than 3 1,000 and left 514,000 homeless.
        The next year, an earthquake of greater magnitude (7.1) occurred in the United
        States; the Lorna Prieta earthquake killed 62, injured 3,757 and left more

        1997, the Federal Emergency Management Agency implemented a national disaster
        mitigation program in seven pilot&#13;\ncommunities across the United States.
        This initiative, Project Impact, was soon expanded to over two hundred city,&#13;\ncounty,
        and regional designations. Its objectives include 1) to build community partnerships;
        2) to identify hazards and&#13;\ncommunity vulnerability; 3) to prioritize
        and complete risk reduction actions; and 4) to develop communication&#13;\nstrategies
        to educate the public about Project Impact. Based on an analysis of one hundred
        thirty-seven in-depth&#13;\ntelephone and face-to-face interviews, community

        regarding the mental health consequences of disasters are rooted both in&#13;\ndisciplinary

        in&#13;\ndisaster mental health studies. However, despite a history of dissensus,
        there are also key issues&#13;\non which researchers agree. Disasters constitute
        stressful and traumatic experiences. However,&#13;\nvulnerability to such
        experiences, as well as to more chronic stressors, is socially structured,&#13;\nreflecting
        the influence of socioeconomic status and other axes of stratification, including
        gender,&#13;\nrace, and ethnicity. Disaster events differ in the extent to
        which they generate stress for victims. A&#13;\nholistic perspective on disaster
        mental health would take into account not only disaster event&#13;\ncharacteristics,
        but also social-systemic sources of both acute and chronic stress, secondary
        and&#13;\ncumulative stressors, and victims\u2019 internal and external coping

        from a random sample of 1,042 households in Memphis,&#13;\nTennessee surveyed
        by the Disaster Research Center prior to&#13;\nDecember 3rd 1990 in connection
        with the Iben Browning&#13;\nprediction of an imminent massive earthquake

        of information; Knopf\u2019s&#13;\nprediction that rumors are part of pre-existing

        determinant of their search for and use of&#13;\ninformal information. These
        findings indicate that&#13;\nShibutani\u2019s model of rumors should be supplemented
        by&#13;\nattention to the importance of cultural context and the&#13;\nlogistics
        of accessibility and micro-participation.&#13;\nUnexpectedly, a large number

        achieve loss-reduction objectives and to enhance community and societal resilience
        in the&#13;\nevent of earthquakes and other disasters, researchers and practitioners
        must take into account the&#13;\nbroader societal environment in which loss-reduction
        solutions are applied. For that purpose,&#13;\nresearchers at the Multidisciplinary
        Center for Earthquake Engineering Research (MCEER) have&#13;\ndeveloped two
        conceptual frameworks that clarify the linkages that need to be made between&#13;\nearthquake
        research and the application of loss-reduction solutions: an open-systems
        approach as&#13;\na strategy for organizing a large scale coordinated research
        agenda applied to a significant public&#13;\nproblem, and market-based metaphors
        to introduce a new way of conceptualizing the loss-reduction&#13;\nprocess.
        This paper presents these proposed conceptual frameworks, which have been&#13;\nused
        by MCEER to formulate its research agenda, for consideration as potentially
        helpful tools&#13;\nfor researchers and for the management of large multidisciplinary

        theorists are concerned with the economic manifestations of social factors
        such&#13;\nas attitudes and norms that at first appear to be unrelated to
        economic activity. These forces&#13;\ninteract to influence the fortunes of
        industries and regions. While typically the regulationist&#13;\napproach is
        applied to place-specific processes of change, the perspective can also&#13;\nprofitably
        be applied to industries that are not place-specific. Using merchant shipping
        as&#13;\nan illustrative case, the paper begins with a broad overview of regulationist
        principles and&#13;\nthen applies them specifically to technological and organizational
        changes that are&#13;\noccurring in the marine workplace. It then discusses
        the role of merchant officers in that&#13;\nindustry and the effects of technological
        change on the organization and character of their&#13;\nwork. The paper will
        show how the regulationist approach evokes a richer theoretical&#13;\nunderstanding
        of change in the workplace and, in so doing, will expand understanding of&#13;\nthe
        mode of social regulation.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-22T21:47:03Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-22T21:47:03Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2001</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/679</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        afermath are a living laboratory for those wishing to&#13;\nbetter understand
        how individuals, groups, and organizations respond under extreme disaster&#13;\nconditions.
        Along with other major disaster events, September 11 revealed much about&#13;\ninstitutional
        responses and collective behavior in crises, underscoring what is already
        known about&#13;\nthe social processes that characterize such events, while
        at the same time highlighting aspects of&#13;\ndisasters that the literature
        has yet to explore fully.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-22T22:12:22Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-22T22:12:22Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2001</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/680</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        behavior framework is utilized to examine the evacuation of the World Trade&#13;\nCenter
        complex following the attacks of September 11. Using both first-person&#13;\nnewspaper
        accounts and media reports, the paper focuses on emerging norms in the&#13;\ndecision
        to evacuate as well as the evacuation process itself. Three key factors affected&#13;\nthe
        decision to evacuate: (1) social location, (2) the role of leaders, and (3)
        the level of&#13;\nperceived threat. Helping behavior, the definition of norms
        in the stairwells, and&#13;\nepisodes of deviant behavior as emerging norms
        were all evident in the evacuation&#13;\nprocess. Panic was not widely observed
        during the evacuation of the Twin Towers.&#13;\nImprovements made following
        the 1993 World Trade Center attack contributed to a more&#13;\nsuccessful
        evacuation.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-23</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-23</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2001</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/683</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        and emergencies are often characterized by heightened levels of&#13;\nstructural
        ambiguity and uncertainty; conditions which may create an&#13;\nopportunity
        for symbolic figures or groups to emerge and ascend to a&#13;\nposition of
        acclaim and high status. In the aftermath of the terrorist&#13;\nattacks of
        September 11, 2001, one group, the Fire Department of New&#13;\nYork (FDNY),
        emerged as an idealized symbol of America at its best. In&#13;\nthe face of
        great uncertainty and unknown risks, firefighters came to be&#13;\nperceived
        as transcending their instrumental actions and vocations to set a&#13;\nstandard
        of readiness, response, and resolve. Drawing on the microprocesses&#13;\noutlined
        by Klapp in his work on symbolic leaders and&#13;\nGusfield's conceptionalization
        of status groups, a multilevel model is&#13;\ncreated with three goals in
        mind (1) extend the explanatory power of&#13;\nprevious work by combining
        macro and micro levels of analysis; (2)&#13;\nprovide a framework for discerning
        why some groups emerge over others;&#13;\nand (3) offer theoretically-informed
        empirical model that is both testable&#13;\nand predictive to the extant research
        on this topic.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-23T20:09:02Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-23T20:09:02Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2001</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/705</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        paper uses culture of opposition theory to identify ten attributes&#13;\nof
        cultures of opposition (CO) in state polities. It then uses these general&#13;\nattributes
        of CO to construct a measure of knowledge of the culture of&#13;\nopposition
        (CO) and of a set of covariates using information from Cuba. Six&#13;\ntheoretically
        derived dimensions are used to group the sixteen covariates&#13;\nincluded
        in the OLS models. They are oppositional politics, respondents'&#13;\nperceptions
        and activities in relation to the dissidence in the island, the&#13;\nuse
        of mass media, integration with state, evaluation of life in Cuba, and the&#13;\neconomic
        situation of the respondents. OLS is used to model the experiences&#13;\nof
        1023 Cuban immigrants who participated in the recently completed survey&#13;\n\"Measuring
        Cuban Opinion Project.\" Six hypotheses are tested. The results&#13;\nsupport
        most of the predictions. Knowledge of the culture of opposition is: a.positively
        associated with the extent to which respondents feel repressed by&#13;\nthe
        state and with their tendency to perceive people to be opposed to the&#13;\ngovernment's
        repressive tactics; b. is positively associated with the extent&#13;\nto which
        respondents develop dissidents' self-conceptions, participate in&#13;\ndissident
        organizations, and perceive people as respecting the dissidents; c.&#13;\nnegatively
        correlated with lack of access to news from abroad; d. negatively&#13;\nassociated
        with membership in state organizations prior to emigrating from&#13;\nCuba;
        e. positively associated with hatred of the leaders and organization of&#13;\nthe
        Cuban state and if respondents thought that there had not been advances in&#13;\npublic
        health and education. Contrary to the prediction, knowledge of the&#13;\nculture
        declines among respondents who faced great difficulties and were&#13;\nengaged
        in marginal, quasi-illegal occupations. The conclusion spells out the&#13;\ntheoretical
        implications of these findings.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-23T21:16:00Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-23T21:16:00Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2001</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/711</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        this paper, we examine the elements of resilience exhibited by New York City
        departments as they responded to the World Trade Center attack in September,
        2001 while at the same time losing their primary emergency operations center
        (EOC) facility at 7 World Trade Center. Our focus lies primarily on the reestablishment
        of the EOC in the days that followed its destruction. Data were gathered during
        exploratory fieldwork commencing within two days of the attack and continuing
        for two months thereafter. We base the results on over 750 collective hours
        of systematically observing key planning meetings and highly secured facilities,
        including the EOC, incident command posts, supply and food staging areas,
        and the disaster site also known as 'ground zero'. The data and findings we
        present in this paper are preliminary; however, they offer initial insight
        into understanding organizational and community resilience in disaster situations
        and therefore warrant our consideration. The paper begins by presenting conceptions
        of resilience as understood from several disciplinary perspectives, noting
        that work in these disciplines has sought to understand how a natural or social
        system that experiences disturbance either sustains its functional processes
        or fails to do so. Although researchers differ in the terms they use to describe
        different features of organizational resilience, they nevertheless orient
        their analyses around such features as redundancy, resourcefulness, communication
        and the capacity for self-organization in the face of extreme demands.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-24T23:45:16Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-24T23:45:16Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2001</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/727</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        and disasters -what is currently&#13;\nknown, what hazard researchers assumed
        they knew before empirical research showed otherwise,&#13;\nand what new insights
        recent research offers. How businesses fare in disaster situations is a new&#13;\ntopic
        in the disaster field. Until relatively recently, there had been virtually
        no research devoted specifically to private sector disaster vulnerability,
        impacts, and recovery. Since the field of disaster research began, the overwhelming
        bulk of the studies carried out have focused on units&#13;\nother than businesses,
        such as households, public sector organizations with public safety and&#13;\nemergency
        management responsibilities, and communities. A considerable amount of research
        has&#13;\nbeen done on the economic impacts of disasters, but those studies
        focused primarily on measuring&#13;\nor modeling the regional and macroeconomic
        impacts following disaster events, rather than on the&#13;\nways in which
        hazards and disasters affect business firms (see, for example, Dacy and Kunreuther,&#13;\n1969;
        Cochrane, 1975; Wright et al., 1979; Friesema et al., 1979; Cohea, 1993; Gordon
        et al., 1995; Jones and Chang, 1995; Rose et al., 1997). Essentially, prior
        to the early 1990s, there had been very few studies assessing disaster impacts
        at the firm level or analyzing how disasters effect these basic building blocks
        of the economy. Even after researchers began looking more closely at private-sector
        organizations, that work typically involved small samples and particular types
        of firms, such as small businesses (Alesch et al., 1993; Kroll et al., 1991)
        or firms representing&#13;\nspecific economic sectors, such as Drabek's work
        on disaster preparedness and response among&#13;\ntourism-oriented businesses
        (1994), Lindell' s research on local emergency planning committees&#13;\nwhose
        activities center on chemical emergency preparedness (1994),' and Lindell
        and Peny's&#13;\nstudies on preparedness measures undertaken by hazardous
        materials facilities (1938). While&#13;\nyielding important insights, findings
        from these kinds of studies cannot be generalized more&#13;\nbroadly to businesses
        of all types.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-25</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-25</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2001</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/729</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        aid</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>The issue here is the relationship between
        disaster and development. In part, the focus of interest is on how the development
        process is affected by disaster. This is important since many countries trying
        to implement development goals are also locations which are hazard prone.
        In such circumstances, disaster may present obstacles to development. There
        is also the implication that disaster has more serious effects in less&#13;\ndeveloped
        nation states and may absorb resources necessary for development. Too, delays
        in recovery might affect \u201Cprogress\u201D in development. Such concerns
        are motivation for understanding how development might be protected from the
        effects of disaster or how disaster assistance, especially international aid,
        might be incorporated into the development process.&#13;\nA major problem
        has been that two separate literatures have developed. The first literature
        has attempted to understand disaster and has given little attention to&#13;\nunderstanding
        the development process. The second literature has involved understanding
        the political economy and alternative conceptions of development which has
        arisen quite independently of considerations of disaster. The effort here
        is to look at both streams of literature on the relationship of disaster and
        development.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-25</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-25</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2002</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/730</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        paper discusses the role of creativity in mounting an emergency response,
        using the&#13;\nWorld Trade Center attack as an exploraiory case study. The
        paper observes that the exercise of&#13;\ncreativity by emergency managers
        is the source of positive adaptive responses to unexpected or&#13;\nrapidy-changing
        situations. The paper notes however that creativity, because of its different&#13;\nmanifestations,
        can introduce a random, unpredictable element into the response milieu, varying
        with the magnitude of the event, and can lead to tensions within an organization
        that vary with the timeframe over which decisions must be made. Volunteers
        and others who converge to a disaster site also exhibit creativity in the
        pursuit of their objectives, which can present both benefits and challenges
        to emergency managers. Nevertheless, creativity will remain an important component
        in initiating and sustaining emergent methods and organizational networks
        that researchers recognize as important- in emergency response. The paper
        suggests that plans and exercises should include a dimension that considers
        creativity.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-25T01:03:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-25T01:03:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2002</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/733</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        given to protecting the cultural&#13;\nheritage from various threats, we note
        in the passing the limitations of the current dominant&#13;\ntechnical approach
        to the problem. After that, the bulk of the paper discusses the social science&#13;\nperspective
        on disasters, and from that advances a dozen themes or general observations&#13;\nderivable
        from research findings developed over the last half century. At the same time
        we note&#13;\nhow these might be applied to problems associated with protecting
        cultural properties especially&#13;\nfrom natural and technological disasters.
        Our paper concludes with an examination of three&#13;\ngeneral questions that
        need to be dealt with by anyone interested in disaster aspects of the&#13;\ncultural
        heritage.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-25T01:09:54Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-25T01:09:54Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2003</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/734</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Trade Center</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Resilience is a property of physical
        and social systems that enables them to reduce the probability of disaster-induced
        loss of functionality, respond appropriately when damage and disruption occur,
        and recover in a timely manner. Resilience can further be conceptualized as
        consisting of four dimensions: robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and
        rapidity. It can be further seen as consisting of technical, organizational,
        social, and economic elements. This analysis focuses on resourcefulness as
        an organizational and social phenomenon. In responding to the World Trade
        Center disaster, organizations exhibited considerable resourcefulness, as
        indicated by the capacity to manage convergence and emergence; by the network&#13;\nforms
        of organization that developed to cope with disaster-related problems; and
        by the ability to address response-related challenges through improvisation.
        Since resourcefulness can be viewed as both collective sensemaking and collective
        action, it is ultimately rooted in the same kinds of social conditions and
        processes that make those activities possible.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-25T01:15:14Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-25T01:15:14Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2003</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/735</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        will be more and worse disasters in the future. Researchers have detailed
        and documented this elsewhere. This negative consequence will result from
        the last stages of two worldwide social trends: industrialization and urbanization.
        However, crisis planning and emergency managing policies can be established
        and steps can be taken that will reduce and weaken some of the negative effects
        of the disasters of the 21 st Century. Among six major ones are: 1. It is
        necessary to explicitly accept the fact that all disasters are essentially
        social occasions that primarily have to be dealt with by social means; far
        more attention needs to be paid to disasters rather than hazards. 2. The distinction
        in planning between natural and&#13;\ntechnological disasters must be dropped;
        there should be a move to a more generic approach to all kinds of crises.
        3. Disaster mitigation&#13;\nshould be made at least as much a priority in
        planning and application as emergency preparedness, response and recovery;
        this would be to take a proactive rather than just a reactive stance to disasters.
        4. An effort should be made to more closely integrate disaster planning with&#13;\nthe
        developmental planning or social change processes of the social system involved;
        disasters do not occur in isolation from larger social&#13;\nprocesses. 5.
        An attempt should be made to ascertain in what ways disaster problems are
        similar to and different from other environmental&#13;\nproblems; there may
        be similarities that can be concurrently addressed. 6. Newer technologies
        ought to be implemented in the four phases of the disaster cycle; however,
        the limits of the technotogies must be recognized and the fact that implementation
        might be more fruitful for certain phases of the cycles than others. There
        is no doubt that if the right policies and measures are put in place, the
        future will not be the past revisited nor will it be only the present repeated.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-25T01:21:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-25T01:21:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2003</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/736</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        the 2001 World Trade Center disaster, New York City experienced high levels
        of individual and organizational convergence: volunteers and groups wanting
        to assist in the response. Since that time, several initiatives across the
        U.S. have developed to encourage volunteer disaster response integration.
        Before 9/11, other formal and informal volunteer organizations had worked
        toward similar goals, and community-based disaster mitigation was&#13;\ntouted
        as a valuable approach in both Canada and the U.S. Drawing upon examples from
        research conducted after the 2001 World Trade Center disaster response in
        New York City as well as research on community based mitigation and response
        programs, this presentation outlines important considerations when planning
        for volunteer and community wide participation in disaster reduction and response
        strategies. Findings point to the value of incorporating community-based groups
        in disaster related issues and decision making, as well as recognizing the
        social capital, resources, and expertise these groups bring to the table.
        This presentation also stresses the need to balance the real considerations
        and challenges that accompany public integration. Establishing and maintaining
        partnerships, incorporating groups not traditionally involved in disaster
        response or mitigation decision-making, setting boundaries, credentialing,
        familiarizing volunteers with existing response systems, and leveraging initiatives
        to maximize mitigation opportunities are some of the issues discussed.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-25T01:28:02Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-25T01:28:02Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/737</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Tips and Guidelines: Conducting Face-To-face Interviews (And Even Focus Groups)</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Rodriguez,
        Havidan</dc:creator>\n<dc:subject>interview process</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>The
        interview process is, to some extent, an art form but it is also based (or
        should be) on scientifically grounded theories and methodologies. In my judgment,
        a good theoretical and methodological background is extremely important to
        allow us to generate the knowledge, expertise, and skills to carryout face-to-face
        interviews.&#13;\nHowever, hands-on experience is instrumental. It is through
        the actual interview process that we will polish and fine tune our skills,
        develop new interview strategies and abilities, and learn to establish an
        interactive process and the \u201Cconnection\u201D between interviewer and
        interviewee that is essential to generate a comfortable and stimulating environment.
        Experience is indeed the best \u201Cteacher\u201D allowing us to identify
        our interview skills, strengths, and weaknesses. Further, if we are reflective
        enough, we should learn from our mistakes thus allowing us to improve the
        quality and results of the interview process.&#13;\nIn order to facilitate
        and enhance the interview process, in the following section, we provide a
        number of practical guidelines and tips (based on observation and experience,
        including my own mistakes). This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of
        tips and ideas. Further, many of these tips are not original and they may
        appear to the&#13;\nreader to be \u201Cobvious\u201D or \u201Ccommon sense,\u201D
        until we discover (after completing the interview) that we committed some
        serious mistakes which may impact the outcome of our research. It is noteworthy
        that the following issues are not necessarily listed&#13;\nchronologically
        or in order of importance (although we have tried to do this as best as possible).
        Thinking about these issues before, during, and after the interview process,
        will allow us to generate a methodology that is systematic, uniform (as best
        as possible), and that will enhance the interview process. That being said,
        as with all types of art forms, creativity and critical thinking is an important
        part of the interview process.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-03-25T01:34:28Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-03-25T01:34:28Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/738</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        data were also collected to supplement the interview data. A telephone follow
        up survey of selected members was undertaken a year after the groups were
        first studied.&#13;\n&#13;\nThis paper reports on the DRC observations and
        findings on the local citizen groups studied which were organized with respect
        to hazardous waste sites (ten cases out of the total). Actually we found few
        differences among emergent citizen groups irrespective of the particular potential
        disaster agent with which they were concerned. In fact, we found little difference
        in the orientation to either technological or non-technological disaster agents,
        which some have speculated is an important distinction affecting the perception
        and behavior of individuals and groups. Such differences in human and group
        behavior as exist are related to other than the physical source of the potential
        risk (e.g. the perceived potential dangerousness of the threat, its perceived
        uncontrolability, etc.; for a general discussion of this see Quarantelli,
        forthcoming and 1985b, and also our earlier study of acute chemical emergencies
        and disasters, Quarantelli,1984b).</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-07T23:33:31Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-07T23:33:31Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1987</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1084</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        lines</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>In this article, we present a mathematical
        model coupled to an experimental study&#13;\nof ant foraging lines. Our laboratory
        experiments do not support the common traffic modeling assumption that ant
        densities and velocities are directly correlated.&#13;\nRather, we find that
        higher order effects play a major role in observed behavior, and&#13;\nour
        model reflects this by including inertial terms in the evolution equation.
        A linearization of the resulting system yields left- and right-moving waves,
        in agreement&#13;\nwith laboratory measurements. The linearized system depends
        upon two Froude&#13;\nnumbers reflecting a ratio of the energy stored in the
        foraging line to the kinetic&#13;\nenergy of the ants. Furthermore, the model
        predicts and the measurements support&#13;\nthe existence of two distinct
        phase velocities.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-18T15:58:25Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-18T15:58:25Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-13</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        this paper we primarily summarize and highlight the major&#13;\nfindings regarding
        reactions of human beings to disaster warnings of&#13;\nan immediate event.
        Response in this approach is viewed more narrowly&#13;\nas the adjustive behavioral
        outcome of the reaction pattern.&#13;\nReaction is the broader set of activities
        involved in exposure to&#13;\nand use of disseminated warning messages, as
        well as other observations&#13;\nregarding a dangerous situation. Our focus
        is on individual reactions to relatively short-term&#13;\nwarnings as might
        be issued in a sudden emergency generated by a&#13;\nflood from a dam collapse
        or sudden river rising, hurricane-typhoon&#13;\nand cyclone, tsunamis or so
        called tidal wave, transportation accident&#13;\ninvolving fire or explosion
        of dangerous chemicals, or a major&#13;\ntechnological accident in a nuclear
        plant. We do not concern&#13;\nourselves with longer term messages which might
        warn about slowly&#13;\ndeveloping disasters such as might be involved in
        famines, droughts,&#13;\nmost epidemics, diffuse toxic poisonings, or even
        long range earthquake&#13;\npredictions. More than logic is involved in distinguishing&#13;\nbetween
        warnings in short run and long run situations. Empirically, research studies
        show there are some qualitative differences in how&#13;\npeople react to warnings
        in the two kinds of situations (e.g., warnings&#13;\nare less recognized,
        believed, and responded to In the long run situations.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-20T19:04:32Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-20T19:04:32Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1983-08</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Article</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1118</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Article;170</dc:relation>\n</oai_dc:dc>\n</metadata>\n

        as these questions are for planning post-disaster mental health and other
        services, there are, as yet, no conclusive answers to them.  In part, the
        problem arises because the complexities of the related phenomena have not
        been addressed systematically.  As will be indicated throughout this paper,
        crucial conceptual distinctions are seldom made.  Even what is empirically
        known is often not well understood because it is not placed under an appropriate
        label or category.  Frequently, these criticisms can be applied to the way

        the general rubric of disaster studies and planning, the Disaster Research
        Center (DRC) of the Ohio State University conducted a series of studies for
        the Defense Civil Preparedness Agency (formerly the office of Civil Defense)
        from 1972 through 1978 with most of the actual work being done during 1972-1975.
        Three major pieces of work were undertaken: (1) a study of the role of local
        civil defense in disaster planning;  (2) a study of the use of local Emergency
        Operating Centers (EOCs) in disasters; (3) a study of the implementation of
        disaster planning. Different sets of data and field operations were used to
        obtain information for the studies. For the first study most of the data was
        derived from research in 12 communities around the country. Data for the other
        two pieces of research was collected from 14 new field studies as well as
        by reexamining previously collected data in the DRC files. In general, it
        was found that under appropriate circumstances local civil defense offices
        can play important roles in local community disaster planning. The value and
        importance of local EOCs in disasters was also confirmed although there are
        a number of problems associated with the use of such facilities. Finally,
        many of the conditions which facilitate the implementation of community disaster
        planning were ascertained.&#13;\nThe first chapter of the report outlines
        the objectives of the work undertaken. objective. In the third chapter the
        research accomplishments are detailed with particular emphasis on research
        which had not been previously reported in earlier documents produced by the
        work. Some conclusions and recommendations are contained in chapter four.
        An appendix provides copies of some of the field instruments used.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-21T22:48:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-21T22:48:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1979-01</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1131</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Final

        I describes and analyzes the research of the Disaster Research&#13;\nCenter
        (DRC) on the responses of local emergency management systems in six&#13;\ncommunity
        disasters. Effectiveness of response was assessed in terms of communication
        which resulted in correct information collection, a fully&#13;\nfunctioning
        EOC, appropriate procurement and distribution of human and&#13;\nmaterial
        resources, proper task delegation and coordination, a legitimated&#13;\nauthority

        state and federal organizations, cooperative relationships with&#13;\nmass
        media groups, and response activities based upon real, not mythical&#13;\nneeds.
        We examined how extensiveness of response was influenced by prior disaster
        experiences, prior planning, and federal aid. We then derived an&#13;\neight-fold
        categorization of emergency management systems: traditional offices, by passed
        agencies,  emergent agencies,established agencies, embedded&#13;\nagencies,
        by-passed community agencies, emergent community agencies, and established
        community agencies. After a comparative examination of the likelihood of the

        a formal NSF reporting&#13;\nrequirement, is intended for many audiences.
        As a general&#13;\nstatement, it is primarily aimed at disaster policy makers,&#13;\ndisaster
        planners, and disaster researchers. While we think what&#13;\nis said can
        benefit many others ranging from at one end--social&#13;\nand behavioral scientists
        abstractly interested in responses to&#13;\ncollective stress situations--and
        at the other end--to many&#13;\noperational personnel concerned with the specifics
        of dealing&#13;\nwith human and social responses to earthquakes--some of our
        other&#13;\npublications more specifically target them as prime audiences.
        Part I of the report provides an introduction to the study. It&#13;\ngives
        a brief overall account of the sociophysical aspects of the&#13;\nearthquake
        and its impact in Mexico City, discusses how a close&#13;\ncollaboration was
        developed with Mexican colleagues prior to DRC&#13;\ndoing any research on
        this disaster, and indicates the kinds of&#13;\ndata that were obtained and
        how they were analyzed by both DRC&#13;\nstaff members and our counterparts
        in Mexico.In Part II we use two major population surveys to describe and&#13;\nanalyze
        the behavior of individual citizens after the disaster.&#13;\nThe first survey,
        undertaken less than three weeks after the&#13;\nearthquake, allows us to
        depict the impact consequences, the mass&#13;\ncommunication behavior of the
        victims, their volunteer behavior,&#13;\nand the attitudes and evaluations
        that the population had about&#13;\ngovernmental and other impact-related
        activities. The second&#13;\nsurvey, done about a year later, permits us to
        discuss the longer&#13;\nrun earthquake problems as seen by citizens, their
        attitudes&#13;\nabout the handling of disaster related problems, and what
        people learned from the experience of the disaster.  Part III includes our
        discussion of organizational behavior in&#13;\nthe aftermath of the disaster.
        First we depict the very complex&#13;\ngovernmental structure in Mexico City
        and the general lack of&#13;\nprior disaster planning, both of which significantly
        affected the&#13;\norganizational response to the earthquake. Then we present
        a&#13;\npicture of the major organizational responses in the first three&#13;\ndays
        after impact, separately followed by a selective depiction&#13;\nof the organized
        responses of both governmental and private&#13;\norganizations up to the end
        of the emergency period, approximately a two week time span. In Part IV we
        further make explicit the major research findings&#13;\nor themes of our study,
        briefly examine the extent to which they&#13;\nmight be applicable to an earthquake
        disaster in the United&#13;\nStates, and indicate what future research ought
        to explore.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-22T16:45:11Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-22T16:45:11Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1988</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1139</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Final

        1. Introduction&#13;\nFrom September 1985 through August 1988 the Disaster
        Research Center&#13;\n(DRC) at the University of Delaware undertook a study
        of local mass&#13;\nmedia response to community disasters. A total of 15 new
        field studies&#13;\nwere undertaken for this research, fourteen in the United
        States and&#13;\none in Canada (and for certain purposes comparable data from
        two&#13;\nearlier studies were also used). The research had a number of specific&#13;\ntopical
        goals, namely the following. First, we conducted a survey of all local media
        outlets in those&#13;\ncommunities in which DRC carried out field work for
        this study. The&#13;\npurpose of the survey was to document the involvement
        of the Local&#13;\nradio, television and newspaper organizations in local
        community&#13;\ndisasters. We were interested in establishing the degree and
        kind of&#13;\nparticipation in the response that the local mass communication
        system&#13;\nwould show in disasters in their own areas. Second, 32 in depth
        case studies were undertaken of the largest and&#13;\nmost involved local
        radio, television and newspaper outlets. The&#13;\nprimary goal of this second
        research objective was to determine the&#13;\norganizational structure and
        news processing patterns of these entities&#13;\nin the emergency periods
        of disasters. Specifically, we examined such&#13;\nintraorganizational and
        interorganizational elements as the-gatekeeping&#13;\nprocess, the decision
        making structure, news sources used, and news&#13;\nprocessing during the
        emergency period and to compare these patterns with normal, day-to-day operations.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-22T17:07:23Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-22T17:07:23Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1989</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1140</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Final

        of This Report&#13;\nThe Disaster Research Center (DRC) at the University
        of Delaware&#13;\nin the fall of 1985 initiated work under Contract EMW-85C-1981
        on a&#13;\nfive year project focusing upon community and organizational response&#13;\nto
        natural and technological disasters. During the First Phase of the&#13;\nproject
        where the work extended over a year, the DRC undertook a&#13;\ncomparative
        study of the responses of local emergency management&#13;\nagencies (LEMAs)
        during the emergency time period of disasters. The&#13;\nFinal Report on the
        First Phase of the work (Wenger, Quarantelli and&#13;\nDynes, 1987) reported
        on both the extensiveness and effectiveness of the disaster response by LEMAs
        in six communities. An empirically&#13;\ngrounded eightfold typology of local
        emergency management arrangements&#13;\nwas developed, and the effectiveness
        of the various types was studied&#13;\nin relation to such variables as disaster
        experience, disaster&#13;\nplanning and federal assistance. In general, we
        found a strong&#13;\npositive relationship between prior disaster experience
        and both the&#13;\nextensiveness and effectiveness of LEMA response. A similar
        pattern&#13;\nwas discerned for prior disaster planning. In addition, we found
        that&#13;\nvarious forms of federal assistance can have positive, salutary&#13;\neffects
        upon local community response. The Second Phase of the research has shifted
        the focus of study&#13;\nfrom LEMAs to local police and fire departments.
        As was the case in&#13;\nthe work in Phase One, there are actually two distinct
        although&#13;\nrelated project activities, i.e., the field work on the organizations&#13;\nbeing
        studied and the work on the computerization of the DRC library and data base.
        \ In this Final Report we discuss the major empirical findins we have generated
        with regard to the response of local police and fire departments to disasters;
        another Final Report summarizes our work on the DRC library and data base
        ( see Quarantelli, 1989).</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-22T17:42:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-22T17:42:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1989</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1141</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Final

        government leaders expressed concerns that, if their community were&#13;\nincluded

        Agency (FEMA) unveiled a new national&#13;\neffort to encourage state and
        local adoption of mitigation policies and programs in an attempt to&#13;\nreduce
        escalating disaster relief and recovery costs (FEMA 1995). In 1996, Director
        James Lee&#13;\nWitt, acknowledging that \u201Call mitigation is local,\u201D
        convened a set of roundtable discussions, which&#13;\nincluded constituents
        from outside the traditional emergency management profession, to consider&#13;\ndifferent
        approaches to local level adoption of mitigation programs.&#13;\nOut of these
        discussions came a new program, originally called the Disaster Resistant&#13;\nCommunity
        Initiative, now known as Project Impact. The overall goal of Project Impact
        is \u201Cto&#13;\nbring communities together to take actions that prepare
        for-and protect themselves&#13;\nagainst-natural disasters in a collaborative
        effort\u201D (FEMA 1997). Unlike other FEMA grant&#13;\nprograms, the mitigation
        activities and strategies were to be developed by the communities&#13;\nthemselves
        to meet local needs and to reflect local social and political cultures. This
        was expected&#13;\nto be a \u201Cbottom up\u201D approach to mitigation. Guidance
        to the communities in how to meet this&#13;\ngoal was provided in four objectives:
        to build community pastnerships; to identify hazards and&#13;\ncommunity vulnerability;
        to prioritize risk reduction actions; and to develop communication&#13;\nstrategies
        to educate the public about Project Impact.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-22T18:49:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-22T18:49:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1998</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1144</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Final

        had made by the end of the first year of&#13;\nProject Impact funding were
        reported in August, 1998. That first year report found that pilot&#13;\ncommunities
        had begun to develop a good understanding of PI\u2019S partnership philosophy,
        that&#13;\nhazard assessment activities were under way, and that focused mitigation
        projects had been&#13;\ninitiated. Among the potential problems that were
        identified were difficulties with motivating&#13;\nprivate-sector organizations
        to become partners in the initiative and some lack of clarity about the&#13;\nkinds
        of activities that constitute mitigation (as opposed to public education and
        preparedness).&#13;\nOverall, DRC found that communities had begun making
        good progress toward encouraging&#13;\nadoption of pre-disaster mitigation
        as a community wide goal, and that the kinds of difficulties&#13;\ncommunities
        reported with embarking on PI were no more serious than those that can be&#13;\nexpected

        Fall 1997, the Disaster Research Center began a two-year study on the development
        and&#13;\nimplementation of Project Impact in the seven communities that were
        chosen as pilot sites for the&#13;\nprogram: Allegany County, Maryland; Deerfield
        Beach, Florida; Oakland, California; Pascagoula,&#13;\nMississippi; Seattle,
        Washington; Tucker County and Randolph County, West Virginia; and&#13;\nWilmington,
        North Carolina. These seven communities were each given a million dollars
        to enhance&#13;\ntheir disaster resistance through mitigation projects, public
        education activities, and the development&#13;\nof public-private partnerships.
        Earlier DRC reports on the lessons learned by these communities&#13;\nduring
        the first year in this new program were intended to provide the Federal Emergency&#13;\nManagement
        Agency (FEMA) with feedback on the types of challenges the communities faced,
        the&#13;\nprocesses they had established to manage Project Impact, the types
        of activities they had undertaken,&#13;\nand the benefits or opportunities
        they derived from participating in the program. In late 1997, FEMA&#13;\nbrought

        Year 2000 (Y2K) computer problem constituted an unprecedented threat for governments,
        the&#13;\nprivate sector, and members of the public worldwide. Y2K presented
        a special challenge for the US&#13;\nDepartment of Transportation (DOT), given
        DOT\u2019s major responsibilities in the areas of national&#13;\nand international
        travel and transport, safety and security, continuity of operations planning,
        and&#13;\ndisaster preparedness and response. To meet that challenge, the
        Department took extraordinary steps&#13;\nto ensure that its own systems remained
        operational into the new millennium, and it also played a&#13;\nmajor role
        in overall Federal readiness efforts and in stimulating private-sector Y2K
        preparedness.&#13;\nThis study, which was undertaken by the University of
        Delaware\u2019s Disaster Research Center and&#13;\nthe George Washington University
        Institute for Crisis, Disaster and Risk Management, sought to (1)&#13;\ndocument
        the strategies DOT used to achieve internal readiness, coordinate with other
        Federal&#13;\nagencies, and support private-sector stakeholders in their remediation
        and preparedness efforts; (2)&#13;\nobtain information on which strategies
        worked well and why; (3) document the short-term and&#13;\npotential longer-term
        impacts of the Y2K readiness effort; and (4) review lessons learned and&#13;\nidentify
        aspects of DOT\u2019s Y2K-related efforts that can be transferred and institutionalized
        in ways&#13;\nthat increase organizational effectiveness. To prepare this

        Close attention must be paid to developing technologies, warning messages,
        and&#13;\ndissemination strategies that succeed in enhancing life safety and
        protecting property. To provide&#13;\nguidance on warning system design, the
        Disaster Research Center conducted a broad and&#13;\nsystematic review of
        the literature on risk communication, hazard and disaster warnings, and&#13;\nwarning
        response. The review addressed a variety of topics, including the different
        types of&#13;\nsystems that are currently used to issue warnings of impending
        threats; the components or phases&#13;\nof the warning process; what is currently
        known about factors that influence the manner in which&#13;\npeople respond
        to warnings; and the problems inherent in issuing warnings that elicit appropriate&#13;\nself-protective
        responses. The review also considered such topics as which types of settings
        are&#13;\nthe most likely candidates for successful SCAN deployment, what
        types of warning signals and&#13;\nmessages people are most likely to heed
        in emergency situations, and what lessons can be learned&#13;\nfrom earthquake
        alerts that have been issued in Mexico City, the only community that currently&#13;\nuses
        a real-time system to provide warnings to the public. Other issues considered
        in this report&#13;\ninclude the potential for negative consequences following
        false alarms or missed alerts, the&#13;\nextent to which fully-automated systems
        could be employed in transmitting real-time alerts, and&#13;\nconcerns centering
        on overall system integration and reliability, equity in the issuing of&#13;\nearthquake
        alerts, and legal liability.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-23T19:03:30Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-23T19:03:30Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2000</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1155</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Final

        its inception, the Disaster Research Center (DRC) has undertaken seven field
        trips. The events covered have been: the dam burst in Baldwin Hills, Los Angeles,
        a chemical plant explosion in Attleboro, Massachusetts, Hurricane Cindy in
        Texas, the Nursing Home fire in Fitchville, Ohio, the Vaiont Dam flood in
        northern Italy, the Indianapolis Coliseum explosion, and floods in the Cincinnati
        area. However, these initial field operations according to plan were used
        primarily for training purposes and pilot studies. More systematic studies
        based in part on the experiences in and findings from these preliminary research
        efforts were visualized as commencing sometime in the spring of this year.
        &#13;\n&#13;\nThe Alaskan earthquake of Friday,  March 27, 1964, therefore,
        occurred just as DRC was in the process of moving to more systematic and quantitative
        kinds of field and analytical procedures. The magnitude of the disaster however,
        precluded waiting upon the development of a more advanced research design.
        The earthquake ranked very high on all the standard criteria used by the DRC
        to evaluate whether it should or should not study a given community disaster.
        The immediate research opportunities offered by this event could not be sacrificed,
        even though a pre-planned and systematic design that would result in qualitatively
        better findings was not yet ready. We say this to indicate our awareness of
        certain limits to the initial DRC operations in Alaska.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-23T15:37:13Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-23T15:37:13Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1964-06</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1149</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Working

        June 16, 1964, at 1:O2 p.m., Japan was jarred by the strongest earthquake
        to hit the country since 1923. The epicenter of the earthquake, which measured
        7.7 on the Richter scale, was in the Sea of Japan about sixty miles off the
        west coast of the main Japanese island of Honshu. While shock movements were
        felt over two-thirds of the land area of the country, the most heavily affected
        region was in the Niigata Prefecture, especially the capital city of the same
        name which is located about 160 miles northwest of Tokyo. The DRC first heard
        of the disaster on Tuesday morning, June 16 (Eastern Standard time), and sent
        three staff members to Japan on June 17. They arrived at midnight, June 18,
        Tokyo time and completed their field work in ten days. Two basic factors affected
        the response to this disaster and consequently the operations of the DRC team.
        As in most other countries in the world, the governmental structure of Japan
        is highly centralized. Local and prefectural units ( the prefecture being
        somewhat similar to an American state) are closely linked and directly responsible
        to national agencies and ministries in the capital city. Thus, much of the
        organizational response to any widespread disaster in Japan occurs in Tokyo.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-23T15:48:15Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-23T15:48:15Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1964-06</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1150</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Working

        in a northeasterly direction, struck the capital of the state, Jackson.&#13;\nIt
        missed the center of the city of about 200,000 people but completely destroyed
        a moderate size factory complex a short distance east of the city as well
        as a shopping center (Candlestick Park) on the southwest edge of the town.
        About 300 of the nearly 500 injured in the whole state were from the Jackson
        area, Out of the 53 persons who died, 20 were killed in the metropolitan area.
        A three man DRC team (plus two attached OSU engineers) arrived in Jackson
        on Friday, March 4. The team made a reconnaissance survey conducting several
        dozen informal interviews with officials in the police department, civil defense,
        the Red Cross, several hospitals and other community organizations. The initial
        field observations suggested that while there had not been a major community
        disaster, some organizational responses in the city might warrant a more intensive
        examination. Subsequently, a DRC team returned to Jackson and conducted a
        partial \"in-depth\" study of the hospital which was closest to the shopping
        center and that had received the first large influx of casualties. In about
        a week's time the second DRC team interviewed approximately 35 persons connected
        with the hospital including physicians, nurses, administrators, paramedical
        and other staff personnel.  The usual complete cooperation was extended, the
        standard DRC field procedures being followed in both the initial and later
        visit. This paper reports some preliminary observations on the activities
        of the hospital most involved in the community disaster response. The focus
        is on organizational rather than medical aspects. Since a more systematic
        analysis of the data will be presented only in a later research report, all
        statements herein are to be taken as tentative rather than definitive. While
        almost exclusive attention is given to one hospital, three others are mentioned.
        When necessary to avoid confusion the hospital studied most thoroughly is
        designated as hospital A. The other three are called B, C, and D. The emergency
        activities of other community groups and organizations are not generally discussed
        except in passing and to the extent such information provides a better&#13;\nunderstanding
        of the situation at hospital A.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-23T16:14:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-23T16:14:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1966-03</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1151</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Working

        Tornadoes</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Palm Sunday Disaster</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>On
        Palm Sunday, April 11, 1965, a total of thirty-seven separate tornadoes touched
        down in six midwestern states killing two hundred and sixty-six persons, destroying
        or damaging over ten thousand buildings and causing over two hundred million
        dollars in property damage. This, the worst tornado disaster in forty years,
        swept through Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Did
        the residents of these areas have any alert or warning of the tornadoes? If
        not, why not? If they were alerted or warned, why were the casualty figures
        so high? These were some of the many questions asked after the disaster, This
        report does not attempt to answer all such questions restricts itself to some
        observations on certain aspects of the warning operative in the state of Indiana
        that fateful day. More specifically, we will describe how information pertaining
        to the imminence of tornadoes in northern Indiana flowed to and/or through
        certain  organizations to its final destination-the general public. To what
        extent did organizations coordinate their alerting activities with each other
        ? Where did they get their information? How did \"he various formal organizations
        define their role in the period? In what way did they go about alerting the
        general public of the impending danger? In other words, what were some of
        the factors that affected the issuing, distributing and receiving of organizational
        information regarding a tornado threat on Palm Sunday in northern Indiana?&#13;\n(We
        shall also briefly examine what, if anything, organizations learned from their

        study examines transnational interaction between Canadian and American&#13;\norganizations
        during their response to the 1997 Red River flood. In particular, the research&#13;\nfocuses
        on:&#13;\n1) the direction and degree of dependency organizations had on their
        cross-border&#13;\ncounterparts for information and response implementation;&#13;\n2)
        the use of formal and informal processes in transnational decision-making
        and&#13;\ncommunication;&#13;\n3) the extent to which standardization inconsistencies
        affected the disaster response;&#13;\n4) whether or not transnational interaction
        occurred primarily between centralized&#13;\nemergency organizations or decentralized
        agencies involved in flood-fighting efforts.&#13;\nThe analysis uses a grounded
        theory examination of cross-border agreements, agency and&#13;\ngovernmental
        reports, newspapers, and interviews conducted with sixty-two key representatives&#13;\nfrom
        principle Canadian and American organizations involved in the flood response.
        The study describes the nature and frequency of the interaction. It finds
        that although&#13;\nseveral problems or areas of confusion developed, transnational
        interaction between organizations&#13;\nduring the 1997 flood was generally
        successful, with respondents reporting satisfaction with the willingness and
        ability of their counterparts to provide information and assistance. The research&#13;\nalso
        identifies ways in which moss-border interaction can be expanded and issues
        that should be&#13;\nconsidered before such implementation occurs. Recommendations
        are listed below in the order&#13;\nthat they are discussed in the body of

        Disaster Research Center has been conducting research on the implementation
        of&#13;\nProject Impact in communities around the U.S. since 1997. In earlier
        studies, research&#13;\nactivities focused on charting the progress of Project
        Impact implementation in the seven&#13;\noriginal pilot communities. This
        report contains findings from DRC field work in other&#13;\ncommunities that
        subsequently joined Project Impact when the program was expanded.&#13;\nIn
        all, ten communities were involved in this phase of DRC\u2019s work-one in
        each federal&#13;\nregion.&#13;\nTo be included in this study, communities
        had to have achieved at least some level of&#13;\nsustained activity toward
        Project Impact goals. The communities chosen for the study&#13;\nvary in size;
        four are small, four are intermediate-sized, and two have large populations.&#13;\nThe
        ten communities also differ with respect to the hazards to which they are
        vulnerable.&#13;\nCommunities were selected to allow for variation in population
        demographics; while&#13;\nsome communities have populations that are predominantly
        Caucasian, others have significant minority populations. To ensure confidentiality
        of study informants, study&#13;\ncommunities are not discussed by name in
        this report.&#13;\nIn 2000, DRC researchers made site visits to each of the
        ten communities, conducted a&#13;\ntotal of thirty-five interviews with Project
        Impact coordinators and other key informants,&#13;\nand collected a wide range
        of Project Impact-related documents. Data that were collected&#13;\nincluded
        information on partnership networks; strategies for developing and maintaining&#13;\npartnerships;
        vulnerable populations targeted by Project Impact activities; the status of&#13;\nrisk
        assessment, mitigation, partnership, and education activities; the organizational&#13;\nstructures
        that were developed to manage Project Impact activities; the benefits and&#13;\nchallenges
        associated with Project Impact participation; and views expressed regarding&#13;\nthe
        future of Project Impact-related activities in the study communities.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-23T20:46:43Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-23T20:46:43Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2002</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1158</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Final

        Tuesday, February 7, 1967, all of these factors combined to produce the most
        destructive fires in the history of Tasmania. Extremely dry weather during
        the  preceding two months had created a serious incendiary hazard throughout
        the State, so that when isolated blazes were reported to fire and police authorities
        during the early morning hours of Tuesday, the problem was not unexpected,
        These first fire reports were from the quasi-mountainous areas in the southeastern
        quarter of the island, generally within 10 miles of Hobart, the capital of
        Tasmania. In this report, we will initially describe the Hobart area and southeastern
        Tasmania. This will be followed by descriptions of the structure of key emergency
        organizations and their functioning during the disaster. Finally, particular
        organizational problems will be discussed, and some general observations and
        conclusions will be presented. This report is a preliminary working paper
        and the ideas herein presented are not based on a systematic analysis of all
        of the available data. Some of the interpretations presented in this preliminary
        report, then, may later be elaborated upon or modified somewhat upon further
        analysis of the data.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-25T22:28:26Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-25T22:28:26Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1967</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        Warning: The March 1964 Prince William Sound Earthquake</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Weller,
        Jack M.</dc:creator>\n<dc:subject>Prince William Sound Earthquake</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Tsunamis</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>warnings</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>responses</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Following
        the Alaska earthquake the Seismic Sea Wave Warning System issued a first advisory
        message indicating the possibility of a tsunami not quite 1 1/2 hours after
        the earthquake, and a formal tsunami warning just over 3 hours after the earthquake.
        By the time the initial advisory message was issued, all affected Alaskan
        communities had already been struck by the locally generated tsunamis or the
        initial waves of the major tsunami. Unofficial warnings led to some saving
        of life; more lives could have been saved if the earthquake itself or initial
        waves had been perceived as warnings, but at some places the waves arrived
        too soon for any warning to be effective. SSWWS warnings were received early
        enough at affected communities outside of Alaska to have induced appropriate
        response (except in Canada which was not part of the system). The responses
        varied greatly, however, from community to community, depending on the experience
        and understanding of system officials and of the public. Fatalities from the
        tsunamis totaled 103 in Alaska and 15 elsewhere. This brief summary of the
        warning of tsunamis associated with the 1964 Alaska earthquake and of human
        responses to these warnings, is not intended to be comprehensive or particularly
        detailed. Its focus is on the general description of the range of warnings
        and of responses among the several communities in Alaska and elsewhere that
        were struck by the tsunamis or warned of possible tsunami effects. Greater
        detail may be found in Geography volume of this series, in which Norton and
        Haas (in press) have discussed the warnings and responses in various Alaskan
        communities and Anderson (in press) has compared the warnings and responses
        at Crescent City, California, and Hile, Hawaii.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-26</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-26</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1970-06</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        enviroment</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>The effects of a natural disaster
        extend beyond the visible and tangible damage caused to the physical surroundings,
        and also involve a qualitative change in the nature of society. There is a
        change from a Gesellschaft-style society to one where relationships and interaction
        between people are based on Gemeinschaft-style sentiments. An analysis of
        the reaction of volunteers in such situations must accordingly take account
        of this transformed nature of society. Modern impersonal society normally
        provides little reason or scope for voluntaristic or altruistic actions. Inasmuch
        as there is volunteerism, it is generally channeled through some organized
        or organizational means. In contrast to this, disaster often evokes many and
        varied instances of volunteer activity, part of it in terms of previously
        planned organization, much of it spontaneous on a group or individual basis.
        Such a response, different from normal social life, is a consequence of the
        transformation whereby the basic sentiments shift from Gesellschaft to Gemeinschaft.
        Since even those organizations geared to disaster activities reach their maximum
        response through the utilization of volunteer activity, an awareness of transformation,
        coupled with a judicious utilization of volunteers, would contribute to the
        overall effectiveness of such organizations.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-26</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-26</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1965</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        the March 27, 1964 Alaska earthquake, a series of seismic sea-waves spread

        and injury in Crescent City, California. In Hilo, Hawaii, on the other hand,
        little property damage occurred, and there were no deaths or injuries. There
        is one obvious explanation for the difference in outcome in the two communities
        considerable wave action occurred in Crescent City following the earthquake,
        while in Hilo there was only mild wave activity and only a slight change in
        the ocean level. However, the evidence indicates that even if Hilo had been
        subjected to the violent wave action which hit Crescent City there still would
        have been little or no injury and loss of life due, to a large extent, to
        the implementation of warning techniques and procedures which had been conceived
        before hand. How do two coastal communities within the same nation differ
        so remarkably in their response to threats of seismic sea waves?</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-25T23:02:46Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-25T23:02:46Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1966-11</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        Alaskan earthquake of 1964, Behavior was analyzed in terms of seven community
        processes: , Preservation of life, What are the important emphases and priorities
        A third activity given attention Very striking was the suspension of typical
        economic activity, leisure and recreation, emergency welfare activity. Where
        data were available, extensive chronologies of events were developed to show
        the pace and sequence of activities, The authors pose the question: What are
        the important emphases and priorities which emerge in a disaster? Preservation
        of life as expressed in search-and-rescue, and medical treatment was given
        immediate and sustained attention. Restoration of utilities and communications
        received priority attention. A third activity given attention soon after impact
        was maintenance of public order. Very striking was the suspension of typical
        economic activity  (manufacture, distribution, sales, finance) and leisure.
        Activity in both of these areas received little attention until the emergency
        was under control. Finally, in a brief epilogue, the contribution of the Alaskan
        \"frontier spirit\" is discussed. A chronology of the various response activities
        in Anchorage is presented in a final section.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-25T23:16:43Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-25T23:16:43Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1967-04</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1163</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Working

        better than none.  While the Alaskan experience suggests that no one could
        have developed plans which would have anticipated every community need and
        problem which followed the earthquake, nevertheless it should be clear by
        now that there are certain general problems which any community will face
        in a disaster and some preparation can be of great value when the community
        is stricken.&#13;\nIn the proceeding sections of this paper we have suggested
        some of the problems and demands which emerged following the Good Friday disaster
        in Alaska.  In certain cases some general plans and procedures have been suggested
        on the assumption that while there are some unique characteristics to every
        community and some idiosyncratic elements to every disaster, nevertheless
        there are some common problems and therefore the possibility of common solutions.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-26T20:25:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-26T20:25:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1967</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1167</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Working

        \ Spontaneous and rapid internal social change often occurs as significant
        community relationships cope with challenges during and after a disaster.
        \ Such is the case with the Russian Orthodox Church in five Pacific Eskimo
        villages during and following the March 27, 1964, Alaskan Earthquake.&#13;\nThe
        five communities investigated in this study are Chenega, Kaguyak, Old Harbor,
        Afognak and Ouzinkie.  All are located along the relatively warm Pacific Coast,
        well south of the frozen winter coast typical of other areas occupied by Alaskan
        Eskimo.  The villages are small, ranging in size from 36 persons in Kaguyak
        and 70 in Chenega to about 200 persons in Old Harbor, Ouzinki and Afognak.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-26T19:49:38Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-26T19:49:38Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1972</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1166</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Working

        in the United States. The ten cases have been selected from those&#13;\nstudied
        by the Disaster Research Center (DRC) and include the following:&#13;\n1963
        Indianapolis, Indiana Coliseum explosion, (2) 1964 Anchorage, Alaska&#13;\nearthquake
        , (3) 1964 Cincinnati, Ohio flood, (4) 1965 Wichita, Kansas plane&#13;\ncrash,
        (5) 1966 Topeka, Ranses tornado, (6) 1967 Fairbanks, Alaska Plood, (7)&#13;\n1968
        Jonesboro, Arkansas tornado, (8) 1969 Glendara, Cslifornia flood and mudslides,&#13;\n(9)
        1969 Sioux Falls, South Dakota flood, and (10) 1969 Minot, North&#13;\nDakota
        flood. These disasters range from a progressive, diffused type, the&#13;\nFairbanks
        flood, to an instantaneous, localized type, the trichita plane crash.&#13;\n(1)&#13;\nOur
        goal is to&#13;\nin formulating&#13;\nprovide the disaster planner with findings
        that can be applied&#13;\napproaches to alleviate disaster disruptions. Given

        activity on the part of many different organizations and brings together many
        that have had little&#13;\ncontact with each other before the event. The disaster
        not only destroys or weakens he normal system of community decision making,
        but it also makes urgent the establishment of a new basis for unity. Organizations
        are affected by an emergency in different ways. Some suspend operations, releasing
        their personnel and other resources for the use of disaster organizations.
        Some established organizations, such as the police hospitals, continue tasks
        that are part of their normal pre-disaster responsibilities. Others notably
        the Red Cross and Civil Defense, are prepared to deal with emergencies but
        must rapidly expand their staffs and resources to do so. Finally, some entirely
        new organizations are brought into being by the emergency (Dynes and Quarantelli,

        certain implications can be derived which can be projected into the more inclusive
        context of probable operational problems which might occur in a nuclear situation.
        The basic assumption made here is that the range of problems experienced by
        the local civil defense unit in a disaster setting would be similar to those
        which would be encountered subsequent to a nuclear catastrophe. Where there
        are differences, they can be visualized primarily as one of degree. With the
        exception of the specific form of secondary threat, i.e. radiation and the
        probability that a wider geographical area will be involved, a nuclear explosion

        relief</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>In a disaster of any magnitude that occurs
        in American society, the Red Cross is certain to be present. Much of the mass
        care which is necessary during such emergencies becomes the responsibility
        of the Red Cross. Too, unlike other emergency organizations, the Red Cross
        has continuing responsibilities in the rehabilitation phase. Because of such
        extensive involvement in disaster activities, only a limited aspect of this
        involvement can be considered here. The concern here is to depict the operations
        of this organization during the emergency period and the possible organizational
        sources of the difficulties it may have in carrying out it activities. In
        this sense, the report is problem oriented rather than concentrating on achievements.
        \ &#13;\n&#13;\nWhile the focus on the report will be on the local chapter
        of the Red Cross in its disaster activities, these local activities have to
        be seen in the context of their relationship to national level policy and
        to Red Gross in its disaster activities, these local activities have to be
        seen in the context of their relationship to national level policy and to
        Red Cross personnel based outside the community. Consequently, after a brief
        discussion of the data upon which this report is based, attention will be
        given t~ the general structure of the Red Cross. In the second chapter, the
        disaster orientation of the Ked Cross is outlined, particularly as this orientation
        is revealed in the emergency demands which the organization accepts as legitimate.
        The bulk of this second chapter, therefore, concerns the tasks which members
        of the Red Cross perform in disaster. &#13;\n&#13;\nSubsequent chapters will
        consider the Red Cross mobilization of personnel and supplies to perform these
        tasks in emergencies (chapter three) and certain problems which occur within
        the organization as a result of this mobilization (chapter four), h e of the
        consequences of mobilization is, of course, the sudden convergence of national
        personnel and local volunteers on the Red Cross. Chapter four will deal, then,
        with the intraorganizational consequences of these dual structures of the
        Red Cross in disaster operations. Chapter five will consider interorganizational
        relationships in these operations and chapter six will deal with some implications
        for the role of the Red Cross in a post-nuclear attack environment.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-28T22:49:34Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-28T22:49:34Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1970-04</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        meaning of collective violence is often apparent only in retrospect. Interpretations
        or\" incidents can more often be understood as a justification for actions
        taken by various observers in their roles as participants. Written history
        is more likely to record an \"official\" position while, on the other hand,
        revolutionary literature will provide a quite different ex post facto view.
        Such conflicting views do not necessarily imply that any single interpretation
        is adequate. It is possible, however, aided by a socio-historical understanding
        of past events, to look at contemporary situations and to place them in a
        context which is leas dependent upon the justifications of participants.&#13;\n&#13;\nRecent
        events in the United States, particularly in the cities and on the campuses,
        have prompted social scientists to give more attention to understanding the
        dynamics involved in collective violence. A literature is beginning to emerge.
        In studying such events, there are many methodological and theoretical problems.
        Most standard social science methods are not easily adapted to the demands
        made on the observation and interpretation of events which have both a long
        historical causal nexus as well as a short dramatic violent culmination.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-28T22:57:47Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-28T22:57:47Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1970-06</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1178</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Working

        sociological relevance of conflict and change is unquestioned though the analytical
        emphasis given these phenomena has varied considerably. Each of these factors
        has been treated conceptually. The interrelationships between them, however,
        have seldom been systematically explicated. This paper represents an attempt
        to specify relevant interrelationships between conflict and change and&#13;\nin
        doing so, hopefully, to provide a perspective for future research. This problem
        may be attacked from a number of levels. The polar extremes would be an analysis
        of conflict and change on the societal level as opposed to one&#13;\non an
        interpersonal level. For our purposes we will be viewing the relationship
        of conflict and change at the community level, including its major sub-units,
        i.e.&#13;\ncommunity organizations. It is felt that in this \u201Cmiddle range\u201D
        gains can be maximized within a manageable framework.&#13;\nSpecifically we
        will be concerned with the effect a community in conflict has upon the potential
        for change in the internal conditions and/or external environmental relationships
        of an organization existent within that context.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-29</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-29</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1970-06</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        in natural disasters and organizational change in post-disaster environments.
        The question, therefore, to which this report addresses itself is the effect

        Chile was jarred by a strong earthquake, just four years and ten months after
        the May 1960 quake which took 5,700 lives in this same country. The epicenter
        of the earthquake was about 127 miles northwest of Santiago, the country\u2019s
        capital. The earthquake registerd 7.5 on the Richter scale and 9.0 on the
        Mercali Scale. It lasted for one full minute across an area of 130, 000 square
        miles and for 2 hours it set seismographs jumping as far away as central Italy,
        some 7,500 miles to the east. For Chile, which lies entirely inside the Pacific
        earthquake belt, was the fourth major earthquake in this century. (Chile experiences
        15 percent of all earthquakes.) There was no permanent organization set up
        to deal with the disaster. Every quake is unique, say Chilean officials, and
        therefore must be dealt with differently. But previous experience with the
        aftermath of earthquakes proved an asset in dealing with this particular event.
        In less than an hour after the earthquake\u2019s impact, the country was being
        mobilized to deal with the disaster and to determine the extent of the damage.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-30T14:41:25Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-30T14:41:25Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1971</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        research at the Disaster Research Center at The Ohio State University has
        allowed a sharper focus on the problem. Field studies have been conducted
        about 100 different natural disaster situations. While our research  has not
        been directed primarily to the problem involved, nevertheless, the data gathered
        permit us to specify more clearly the conditions under which conflict and
        the conditions under which cooperation emerge at times of major emergency.
        WE have firsthand data on many cases allowing use to make a more intensive
        analysis than could either students of the problems. The research focus of
        the Center has been on the urban community and the major organizations and
        groups likely to be involved in collective response to a larger-scale disaster.
        Not only has the immediate emergency period been examined, but some attention
        has also been given to longer run responses during the relief and rehabilitation
        periods in the aftermaths of disasters. Thus, we have been in a position to
        observe both short-run and long-run community conflict and cooperation in
        such stress situations.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-30T15:41:22Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-30T15:41:22Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1971-03</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1187</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Working

        want to express as explicitly as possible the current direction of our thoughts
        about DRC\u2019s study of organizational changes designed to meet the problems
        of response to community crisis. The most important reason for expression
        of these tentative and diffuse ideas is to provoke responses about their relevance,
        fruitfulness, and omissions; most of all a push in a fruitful direction would
        be appreciated. The baselines for our current thinking derive from DRC\u2019s
        and personal experiences in various crisis-relevant organizations (police,
        fire, hospitals, etc. which have been observed to change plans, policies,
        organizational structure, etc. because of anticipation of possible crisis
        response; and the literature on organizations. DRC\u2019s research experience,
        through our selective perceptions, indicated low levels of change in disaster-relevant
        organizations even after experience of disaster has clearly demonstrated the
        shortcomings of current organizational plans and preparations. It has also
        indicated relatively high levels of innovation in anticipation of possible
        civil disturbances, even in some cases where community factors make them seem
        unlikely. Presently, important research goals would seem to be development
        of more extensive and systematic data on the empirical distributions and patterns
        of organizational innovation in anticipation  of crisis and attempts at ordering
        possible factors which may account for the empirical similarities and differences
        in organizational innovation.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-30T16:08:30Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-30T16:08:30Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1971-06</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1188</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Working

        2:03 p.m., Tuesday, September 22, 1964, a fire was reported at the junction
        of Mountain Drive and Coyote Road, several miles northeast of Santa Barbara,
        California. A tanker truck from the Mountain Drive Forest Service station
        arrived on the scene almost immediately, and by 2:25 p.m., two converted World
        War II bombers and begun dropping a fire-retardant on the area. Throughout
        the day, 8 air tankers, 2 helicopters and crews, 28 tankers, 8 tractors, and
        250 firefighters plus Santa Barbara County and City, and Montecito Fire Departments
        were called into service increasing to a total 1, 500 men by 5:00 a.m. Wednesday.
        Later a Forest Service official reported that the fire was moving in a northeasterly
        direction with hot, six to eight mile-per-hour winds and gusts up to forty
        mile-per-hour quickly increasing its strength, causing it to move toward Hide
        Track, a residential area just above East Mountain Drive, and down toward
        Westmont college. In addition to their fire suppression activities, the Forest
        Service&#13;\nconducted a detailed investigation in order to determine the
        cause of the&#13;\nfire, to establish its point of origin, and to verify suspected
        arson activity&#13;\nduring the fire.  The primary investigation team consisted
        of a district Forest Service official and the prevention officer from the
        area in which the&#13;\nfire originated; in this case the Mission Canyon area.
        As the fire became&#13;\nlarger and more complicated, the zone and regional
        investigators were&#13;\nrequested to offer their services. Additional investigation
        teams were formed with other agencies to investigate the accidents which occurred
        at Romero Saddle and La Cumbre Peak, and any private complaints voiced against
        Forest Service activity during the fire suppression activity.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-30T16:27:41Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-30T16:27:41Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1971-07</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        have always been a familiar part of man's experience&#13;\nand they have been
        a rather constant setting for posing questions about man's&#13;\nexistence
        and death.&#13;\nToday, an examination of the news media forces one to the
        conclusions that disasters continue to be worthy of attention.  We accept
        this attention as natural, and perhaps it is, since disasters continue to
        provide the context in which significant human dramas are reveled. Disasters
        are perhaps one of the few situationsin which there is both the opportunity
        for the expression of heroism as well as for the ability to confront fear
        and suffering.  And this is played out on a rather dramatic stage for the
        spectators to see.&#13;\nFor those persons whose lives are characterized by
        the&#13;\nrepetitiveness of day-to-day living, disasters provide a vicarious
        contact with these rather universal themes.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-30T18:49:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-30T18:49:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1971-08</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1190</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Working

        Movement</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>There is considerable variation among
        social movements in the degree to&#13;\nwhich they are organized and Integrated.
        Usually, however, integration and&#13;\ncoordination are problematsic for
        social movements as they tend to be marked&#13;\nby considerable dissensus.
        As Rillian has noted: \"Many movements are comprised&#13;\nof diverse segments,
        each with its own structure, loosely united only by their&#13;\nallegiance
        to the central, explicit values and by the tendancy of outsiders&#13;\nto
        view them as parts of a single who1e.\" In many cases, there is no overall&#13;\nformal
        organlzation or structure which wields such diverse elements together.&#13;\nIn
        fact, the interaction between the various components of a social movement&#13;\nis
        often characterized by conflict. There are points in the life history of some
        social movements, however,&#13;\nwhen the disintegrative tendencies are cancelled
        out, or are temporarily&#13;\nneutralized. Such periods are characterized
        by a growing consensus among the&#13;\nvarious components of a movement regarding
        such matters as goals and tactics,&#13;\nand a heightened sense of in-group
        consciousness. Under these circumstances,&#13;\ngreater coordination and integration
        may emerge among the diverse segments of&#13;\na movement, thus enabling it
        to have a profound affect upon its environment.&#13;\nIn this paper, we will
        present a case study of a movement, more specifically&#13;\nthe labor movement
        in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles, which underwent such a&#13;\ntransformation
        beginning in May, 1969, hence the designation of this transformation&#13;\nas
        the \"May Movement.\" Prior to this period, the labor movement in &#13;\nCuracao
        was highly fragmented, lacking the basis for sustained coordinated&#13;\naction.
        Among other things, the dissensus within the movement involved&#13;\nideological
        and political considerations. The transformation of the labor movement assured
        several forms, the most dramatic being a riot during which there was loss
        of life and many injuries, and mlllions of dollars in property&#13;\ndamage.
        In the discussion to follow, we will describe and offer an explanation &#13;\nfor
        the various forms the transformation of the labor movement took beginning&#13;\nin
        May, 1969. Also, we will more briefly consider some of the consequences that&#13;\nthe
        transformation of the labor movement had for its environment.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-04-30T20:03:36Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-04-30T20:03:36Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1971-09</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1192</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Working

        disaster</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs)
        have become in recent years standard features of disaster activities in most
        American communities. This brief report examines some of the problems and
        difficulties associated with their use during time of stress. The observations
        reported are drawn form an analysis of the data gathered by the Disaster Research
        Center (DRC) in actual field studies of nearly 100 different disasters since
        late 1963. Thus, the report covers the functioning of local EOCs in almost
        all major natural catastrophes and many moderate magnitude in the United States
        in the last eight years, as well as their use in some related community emergencies
        (e.g., major explosions, forest fires, dam breaks, etc.) Since our purpose
        is to arrive at generalizations and to establish common elements, specific
        disasters and localities and organizations are not identified in the report.
        It should also be noted that our focus is explicitly on problems and difficulties.
        This is because we are interested in noting implications for disaster and
        emergency planning. Such a focus should not obscure the general point, which
        we shall restate later, that the concept of a local EOC for disaster purposes
        is a very valid one, and that most function relatively well in most emergencies.
        Our highlighting of problems and difficulties, however, is an attempt to suggest
        and imply ways of further improving their efficiency and effectiveness in
        crisis situations. We should also note that as pre-planned EOCs have become
        standard features of local American community life in the last few years,
        some of the following observations were more relevant in the past than now.
        Likewise, our observations are less applicable to disaster prone communities
        than to areas with little disaster experiences. However, while these qualifications
        are necessary in specific instances, nevertheless, what follows is probably
        a rather accurate picture of the problems and difficulties in the use of local
        EOCs in natural disasters in American society.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-01T18:46:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-01T18:46:57Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1972</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        19, 1972, a southbound tow of nine barges hit the head of Shippingport Island
        in the Ohio River, an area just north of the heart: of Louisville, Kentucky.
        Upon ramming the island, four of the nine barges broke loose and drifted downstream
        on the north side of&#13;\nShippingport Island through an area known as the
        Falls of the Ohio. barge was immediately recovered; a second barge with a
        cargo of chrome ore was lost and presumed sunk; a third barge laden with sulfuric
        acid came to rest next to a hydroelectric plant making up part of McAlpine
        Dam and wag retrieved some days later. The fourth barge, and the one of concern
        in this study, carrying 640 tons of liquid chlorine in four pressurized cylinders,
        lodged partly submerged in the second of four tainter gates in the McAlpine
        Dam. Data for this report were gathered by two Disaster Research Center (DRC)
        field teams that visited Louisville on two different occasions during the
        month of April, 1972. Intensive interviews were conducted with one or more
        officials in 14 federal, state, county, city and private organizations actively
        involved in the evacuation preparations and operations. Only indirect attention
        was given to those agencies such as the National Weather Service or the salvage
        contractor who had little to do directly with the evacuation but were primarily
        concerned with engineering aspects of the salvage operation and/or with providing
        technical information about the state of the salvage progress and meteorological
        conditions. Other data sources utilized in this study included some field
        observations during the operation, a wide variety of mass media accounts,
        and various memoranda, reports and other written documents obtained from different
        organizations.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-01T19:28:26Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-01T19:28:26Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1972-08</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        the end of World War XI, social science research into natural disasters has
        emerged as a field of study. The bulk of this research is concentrated in
        two countries: Japan and the United States. Several years ago, initial contact
        was made between the two major groups involved, the Japanese scientists working
        with Prof. Kitao Abe of the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies and the American
        scientists working at the Disaster Research Center at The Ohio State University&#13;\nwhere
        Prof. E.L. Quarantelli is Co-Director. The result of the first contacts between
        Prof. Abe and Prof. Quarantelli led to an effort to exchange information about
        past research in both countries and a desire to see if joint or cooperative
        research could be undertaken in the future. The conclusion from these early
        contacts was that a common meeting of American and Japanese scientists would
        be a very fruitful way to synthesize past research and to plan future research.
        Consequently,&#13;\nsupport was sought and obtained from the National. Science&#13;\nFoundation
        and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, to hold a five day seminar
        at the Disaster Research Center at The Ohio State University in Columbus,
        Ohio of the major social scientists in both countries engaged in disaster
        research. This paper summarizes the themes and conclusions of that seminar
        meeting held from September 11 to September 15, 1972.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-01T20:35:03Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-01T20:35:03Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1972-11</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1197</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Working

        the interests of data manageability, the present study has a very specific
        focus. We are concerned with obtaining a detailed descriptive account of activities
        in t e realm of three disaster-related task areas: warning; evacuation, search
        and rescue; and community order. On the basis of these detailed accounts and
        responses to further structured probing, we shall conduct an analysis of community
        coordination from an inter-organizational relationships perspective.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-01T20:41:59Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-01T20:41:59Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1970</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1198</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Working

        examining the reaction of a particular community throughout the various phases
        of a disaster, it must be noted that this response is, at least in part, dependent
        upon its previous experience with similar disaster events. That is, previous
        community activity provides some residue of learning which is applied in subsequent
        situations. Disaster \u201Ccultures\u201D or \"subcultures\" appear to develop
        in many communities that experience repetitive impact from specific disaster
        agents. These communities in effect have institutionalized methods of response
        to disaster agents, and incorporate various elements of these response mechanisms
        into their local culture.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-01T20:46:38Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-01T20:46:38Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1972-11</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        February 10, 1973, press reports indicated that a largely unexpected and very
        heavy snowstorm hit large sections of the southern United States, an area
        unaccustomed to such an event. Statements by various officials and requests
        for a&#13;\nfederal declaration of a disaster suggested that some localities
        had experienced a severe emergency and a crisis because of the heavy snow.
        On the basis of these and other reports, the Disaster Research Center sent
        a three-man research team to Columbia, South Carolina. The team stayed three
        days, from February 26 through February 28, concentrating on storm-associated
        activities around the state capital of Columbia, and attempting to get answers
        to three questions: &#13;\n(1) If a disaster had occurred, in what way and
        bow was the community response coordinated &#13;\n(2) What role did the local
        civil defense organization play in the coordination and other storm-associated
        organizational responses; and, &#13;\n(3) To what extent would it be possible
        in such a kind of situation to assemble documentary data, especially organizational
        Logs, by which we could reconstruct the sequence of organizational events
        and actions happening before, during and after a community emergency?</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-01T20:57:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-01T20:57:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1973-03</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        major problem in this area stemmed from the high level of Lake Ontario. This
        high level, along with the even higher waves which accompanied the March 17
        storm, caused severe erosion along much of the shore of Lake Ontario from
        St, Catharines to Vhitby and beyond. In the area which we selected for study
        this posed a parricular threat, for the erosion at the foot of the shoreline
        bluffs caused landslides at the top of the bluffs, leaving some homes very
        near the edge of the bluff and in danger of sliding&#13;\nover. Further along
        the shoreline the major problem was simply the high water level itself, which
        threatened to flood some homes and cottages on a sand spit between the Lake
        and a bay.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-01T21:03:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-01T21:03:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1973-03</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        work on sociobehavioral aspects of disasters was first undertaken in the United

        of literature has since been produced by the critical mass of researchers
        who have developed in both countries. At present also, the most intensive
        and extensive studies on the topic anywhere in the world are being pursued
        in America and Japan. For about fifteen years, there has been informal contact
        between some researchers in the two countries, especially between the Disaster
        Research Center (DRC) and the oldest of the Japanese groups involved in disaster
        research, that headed by Professor Kitao Abe. These professional ties were
        strengthened in 1972 as a result of a week-long formal conference held at
        DRC where information was exchanged between ten Americans and eight Japanese
        disaster researchers. Contacts and visits between individual researchers in
        the two countries as well as meetings in the context of international conferences,
        such as at the World Congress of Sociology in Uppsala, Sweden in 1978, have
        continued to further bring together disaster researchers in the United States
        and Japan.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-02T22:32:09Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-02T22:32:09Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1982</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1203</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Final

        the work reported on in this summary report was initiated, it was visualized
        as the initiation of a five-year study of the behavior of organizations in
        the emergency time periods of community disasters. The initial focus in the
        first year was to be on emergent groups. Through case studies drawn from 6-8
        new field studies (the maximum possible under the limited funding available),
        and a reexamination of data already in the Disaster Research Center (DRC)files,
        we intended to write at the conclusion of the first year a report: (1) summarizing
        what we had found about the nature and functioning of emergent groups; (2)
        suggesting the circumstances which generated the appearance of such groups;
        and (3) indicating what our findings and observations implied about disaster
        preparedness and response. As such, and as stated in the proposal to FEMA,
        the report mentioned was visualized as a progress report about early work
        on a projected longer run study. More specifically, we said \"a progress report
        will be written providing study methodology, initial impressions, and pointing
        out what they might suggest for disaster planning and responses.\"</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-02T22:34:24Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-02T22:34:24Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1983-09</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1204</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Final

        as an overall introduction to our work. disaster researchers and social and
        behavioral scientists who might want to know how we conducted our study and/or
        who might be interested in the inductively but empirically generated hypotheses
        and models we generated. With a heavy emphasis on research procedures and
        general findings, the r~ ort does not present much of the data as such. The
        more specific details, including the quantitative and qualitative data are
        given in the more specialized cmpleted or planned papers and publications
        listed in an appendix to this report. Similarly, while we allude to some of
        the implications of our work, those policy makers, planners, and citizens
        concerned with disasters, will have to look at our other writings other than
        this volume, to derive concrete and specific applications of our research
        results. However, this report is primarily aimed at The relocation of DRC
        from Ohio State University to the University of Delaware at the end of December
        1984, while it did not interfere with the completion of the data gathering
        phase of the project, did delay more than would otherwise have been the case,
        the finishing of some of the more specific analyses and more specific topical
        papers that were planned. It is anticipated that the uncompleted analytical
        and writing work will be concluded in the coming months. However, there is
        no reason to think that the yet unfinished specifically oriented analyses
        will alter or modify in any significant ways the general findings summarized
        in the this final report, which is partly based OF more than two dozen publically

        is helpful in studying disasters to be able to generalize about many types
        of disasters. It is possible to talk about disaster threats in terms that
        apply equally wel1 to a flood, tornado, earthquake, or civil disturbance.
        This can be done because while there are differences between the several types
        of threats, there are also many similarities. Thus, in this report we may
        talk about the \"warning process\" in terms that will apply not only to floods,
        but, with a little adaptation, to most disaster situations. In this introduction
        some time is spent discussing the most important variables of disaster stiuations.
        By specifying these variables, we can make important distinctions among disaster
        situations and also relate them to other social phenomena such as chronic
        social problems or gradual social trends. A second section of the introduction
        is devoted to a discussion of warning as a process. The three stages of the
        warning process are outlined. The matter of response, as it relates to warnlng,
        is also considered. The third section of the introduction informs the reader
        about the techniques of data collection that were used in gathering material
        for this study.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-02T22:42:38Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-02T22:42:38Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1968</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        March continuing to the end of April 1973, three&#13;\nflood crests on the
        Mississippi River caused property damage and disruption in&#13;\nthree counties
        surrounding St. Louis, Missouri and, to some extent, in the city itself. While
        press reports seemed to indicate that the actual impact on the&#13;\ncity
        was not major, there did appear to be a mobilization of organizations in the&#13;\ncity
        in preparation for and response to such an event. On the basis of press &#13;\nreports
        and other information, the Disaster Research Center (DRC) sent a two-man&#13;\nfield
        team to St. Louis. The team stayed two days, May 3 and 4, concentrating&#13;\non
        flood-associated activities in St. Louis and the three surrounding counties&#13;\nand
        attempting to get answers to the following questions: (1) If a disaster had
        occurred, in what way was the community response&#13;\ncoordinated in two
        emergency task areas:&#13;\nwarning and pre-impact activities.(2) What role
        did the local civil defense (CD) organization play in the&#13;\ncoordination
        of warning and pre-impact activities;&#13;\n(3) Did the flood situation and/or
        the CD flood activities have any effect&#13;\non how the community and the

        in the morning of May 27, 1973 a series of three tornadoes struck&#13;\nJonesboro,
        Arkansas causing three deaths and extensive property damage. A two-&#13;\nperson
        field team from the Disaster Research Center (DRC) arrived in the community&#13;\nthe
        next afternoon and began observing community attempts at coordination and&#13;\nrecovery.
        Relevant organizational officals were both formally and informally&#13;\ninterviewed
        and numerous meetings were affected. On Wednesday, May 30, an&#13;\nadditional
        field team from DRC came to Jonesboro. The combined teams interviewed&#13;\nmost
        of the local and non-local officials involved in the community's disaster&#13;\nresponse
        as well as talked with a number of private citizens and tornado victims.&#13;\nThe

        Massachusetts Fire</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>At 3:56 p.m. on Sunday, October
        14, 1973, a fire in an abandoned warehouse was sighted which would eventually
        destroy 18 city blocks and damage 12 others in&#13;\nChelsea, Massachusetts,
        a city of around 32,000 people and an industrial satellite of Boston.  At
        its height, this conflagration was thought to be a \"fire storm\" with the
        smoke of the blaze visible from as far as 50 miles away. Because of the &#13;\nlarge
        area affected, and the number of fire departments involved in controlling&#13;\nthis
        conflagration, the Disaster Research Center took this opportunity to study
        the organized response to a relatively rare phenomena in present day American
        cities,a massive fire situation. A two-person research team was sent to Chelsea,
        Massachusetts, staying two days, October 16 and 17. Their focus was primarily
        on the mobilization and coordination of the various fire departments involved,
        as well as some of the supporting organizations' activities.&#13;\nThe following
        general questions were asked to obtain the information: (1) Who took charge
        of the fire departments' response to the fire? (2) What organizations (fire
        departments, police departments, National Guard, etc.) were involved in the
        emergency period? (3) How were the various emergency organizations mobilized?
        And how were they then coordinated? (4) What were the problems confronted
        in this massive fire situation? (5) What role did the local civil defense
        organization play in the coordination of activities?</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-04</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-04</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1973-10-14</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        is a vast amount of sociological literature which deals with the relationship
        of organizational membership and organizational change. Recently attention
        has been focused on deliberate attempts by researchers and others to intervene
        in organizations (Corwin, 1972). Organizational change programs,&#13;\nirrespective
        of their goals, frequently attempt to modify the organizational structure
        through, at least in part, the inclusion of outsiders who are unconventional,
        creative, flexible, good boundary personnel, etc. (Carlson, 1962; Clark,&#13;\n1968).
        fn the future, sociological studies of intervention strategies are likely
        to become more important since increasingly there are programs attempting
        to manipulate&#13;\nstructural variables. Therefore, it will be useful and
        indeed necessary to have the relationship of variables such as staff composition
        and organizational structures variables empirically verified. This study of
        police-community relations&#13;\nP-CR) units, the findings of which are part
        of a larger study conducted by the Disaster Research Center (DRC) of the Ohio

        Response Committee</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>The most cogent feature of
        the 1974 Manitoba flood response was the highly developed nature of the disaster
        sub-culture which exists within a wide spectrum of government organizations
        and departments within the province. While this can be seen as being, in large
        part, a function of&#13;\na continuing yearly flood threat, nevertheless the
        Manitoba response was not only particularly well organized, but was developed
        on an anticipatory rather than an emergent basis. The Manitoba response was
        especially notable in five areas: 1)careful monitoring of weather and water
        level and flow conditions, 2)adequate warning to threatened municipalities,
        3)precise definition of flood tasks per an explicit disaster plan, 4)pre-existing
        lists of resources available&#13;\nduring a time of emergency, and 5) provision
        of a high level of autonomy and financial resources for the flood control
        operation. The Flood Forecast Committee was found to carefully monitor the
        environment each spring to determine the possibilities of flooding that year.
        As required, various levels of flood response activity correspond with the
        gravity of the threat as determined by the Committee's forecasts. In 1974,
        this allowed serious preparations for flooding to begin a month in advance
        of the actual event, and the flood headquarters to be set up&#13;\nthree weeks
        in advance.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-05T23:45:51Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-05T23:45:51Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1974-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        the Energency Measures Organization was divided into three segments based
        on Provincial, County and Municipal organizations each contributing to the
        costs with the Federal Government on a 75 percent, 12 1/2 percent, 12 1/2
        percent basis. All efforts in this field were supervised and controlled by
        the Province, and depended mainly on volunteers. In 1967 there was a major
        change in the concept of Provincial Government operations, centralizing many
        of the responsibilities of the Municipal Government and dissolving the existing
        County Government system. At this time, E.M.O. became a sole provincial operation
        based on a Provincial Headquarters and five areas, each with its own headquarters
        and small staff. &#13;\n&#13;\nAfter the 1968 Federal budget cut, the Provincial
        Government lost little time in initiating its own E.M.O. cutbacks. In the
        spring of 1968, the New Brunswick Government announced a major re-organization
        of the provincial E.M.O. From a separate entity, E.M.O. was absorbed into
        the Municipal Affairs Department, and the Deputy Minister of that department
        was appointed Provincial Co-ordinator. Staff was reduced to one full-time
        training officer, and his secretary. The inventory of equipment accumulated
        by New Brunswick E.M.O. was transferred to departments of government whose
        normal activities were allied to a number of responsibilities previously the
        sole jurisdiction of New Brunswick E.M.O. A member of the Provincial Government
        which initiated these measures explained, in an attack on the proposed expansion
        of E.M.O. four years later, that his government had decided that \"there was
        very little these people could do or were asked to do.\u201D</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-06</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-06</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1974-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        Friday, May 17, 1974, communities along the Grand River in Southwestern Ontario
        were hit by the worst flash flooding in twenty years. Most seriously affected
        were sections of the cities of Cambridge, Kitchener and Brantford. With a
        scarcely developed disaster subculture, an incomplete flood control system,
        and a new regional municipal governmental system which was still undergoing
        assorted growing pains, problems in communication, co-ordination and coping
        were to be expected. This&#13;\npaper will examine these problems in relation

        at DRC may restrict the fulfillment of the ideal.  Thus, these recommendations

        In The Development Of Propositional Inventories In The Field Of Disaster Research</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Aguirre,
        Benigno E.</dc:creator>\n<dc:subject>Method</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Inventories</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Propositions</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>At
        present the term \"propositional inventory\" has a wide variety&#13;\nof meanings
        in the behavioral sciences. The term has been used, for&#13;\ninstance, as
        a synonym for \"annotated bibliography\" (Committee, 1953),&#13;\nfor a \"list
        of references\" (Bonjean, 1967), for a \"descriptive compendium\"&#13;\n(Allswang
        and Bova, 1964) and for \"psychological tests\" (Holtzman,1970). A number
        of scholars (Price, 1968; Williams, circa 1939; Borelson and Steiner, 1964)
        include in the term discussion and evaluation of the&#13;\npropositions as
        well as definitions of the concepts used in them. Goode&#13;\n(1971) however,
        restricts, I think appropriately, the meaning of the&#13;\nterm to a listing
        of formal declarative statements of relations between two or more variables.
        \ Of course, authors differ in the extent to which they use a propositional
        format. Thus, for instance, Perry, Gillespie,&#13;\nand Mileti (1974), Marsh
        (1967), Drabek, Haas and Mileti (1975), and&#13;\nKreps and Weller (1974),
        in contrast to Barton (1969) and Dynes (1970),&#13;\nexplicitly attempt to
        generate and integrate propositions in their work&#13;\nof synthesis and model
        building. As is generally recognized (Price, 1968: 10-11; Zetterberg, 1965)
        the conceptual and methodological difficulties involved in constructing&#13;\npropositions
        and propositional inventories are many.&#13;\nThis paper attempts to make
        explicit these difficulties and to offer tentative solutions to&#13;\nsome
        of them. Hopefully, others will in the future modify, amend, correct,&#13;\nand
        otherwise improve on what is offered here.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-06T15:27:20Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-06T15:27:20Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1976-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        that this first general proposition is most applicable to community type disasters
        and behavioral dysfunctional ties; and (3) that even accepting the first two
        points does not deny the need and usefulness for mental or crisis counseling
        services in a variety of different kinds of disaster situations.  Stated another
        way, we are saying that disasters, as a whole, do not have major health effects
        but that this proposition has to be qualified.  It is primarily applicable
        to negative behavioral consequences of community disasters and there is the
        additional qualification, that even if true, the general proposition does

        Wayne, Indiana, is located in the northeast sector of this midwestern state.
        From March 12 through March 19, 1982, Allen County, Indiana, and specifically
        the city of Fort Wayne, experienced a major flood. Two rivers, the St. Mary's
        and St. Joseph's join to create a third river, the Maumee, in Fort Wayne.
        All three rivers went above their&#13;\nrespective flood stages in March,
        1982, due to snowmelt and heavy rain. The extent of the subsequent disaster
        was beyond the normal, planned means of local officials and calls for volunteers
        to fill sandbags and rebuild dikes were extended through the media. Approximately
        30,000 individuals, including about 18,000 students responded to the crisis
        and effectively turned back flood waters to save many homes. The high degree
        of organization required to coordinate this effort was largely in place prior
        to the flood. The scope of the disaster, however, stretched management capabilities
        beyond expectation. Volunteers filled gaps in disaster response--as they perceived--as
        well as offering services to local officials.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-07T14:25:37Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-07T14:25:37Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1984-10</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        expectations, however. More city employees worked overtime than was expected,

        the course of the next several days, we will have the opportunity to conceptualize
        a research agenda which will be appropriate for a region as well as significant
        for the social sciences. This is an unusual opportunity since research problems
        for the social scientists are usually a part of some one else's agenda, either
        governmental policy agencies or by implications derived from other scientific
        endeavors. For example, meteorological agencies have often asked the question
        \"Why do people ignore our warnings?\" but are seldom content to listen to
        distinctions which point out the difference between meteorological forecasts
        and warning messages. Nor do they formulate the question \"How can meteorological
        agencies issue messages in such a way in which people will give attention
        to them?\" In other agendas, questions are often phrased so tat they imply
        technological answers, rather than \"social\" solutions. For&#13;\nexample,
        the question of \"what can be done to prevent flooding?\" usually evokes answers
        about building more dams and levees when part of the answer might emerge if
        the question were raised \"what is the most efficient and rational use a society
        can made of flood prone lands?\"</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-07T14:39:44Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-07T14:39:44Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1989</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        E. L.</dc:creator>\n<dc:subject>emergency</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>catastrophe</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>In
        everyday speech, the word \"emergency\" usually signifies a sudden and unexpected
        condition calling for immediate action. In the last four decades, social scientists
        starting from popular usages of the term, have increasingly attempted to conceptualize
        emergency as part of the social situation generated by natural and technological
        disasters or catastrophes. In fact, to a considerable extent, the theoretical
        work and empirical research on the social aspects of disasters is the equivalent
        of the social scientific analysis and study of emergencies. Actually whether
        the term \"disaster\", \"catastrophe\" or emergency'' is primarily used, seems
        to depend on the particular language involved. For example, Italian social
        scientists have somewhat preferred to use the term \"emergency\" whereas Americans
        have been inclined to employ the word disaster\" even though the substantive
        phenomena being discussed is about the same in both cases. However, since
        most of the social scientific literature that exists in the area uses \"disaster\"
        rather than \"emergency\" or \"catastrophe\", we will in this article mostly
        but not exclusively use the first term. Part of this tendency and also lack
        of complete consensus can be attributed to the fact that social science studies
        in the area are but about four decades old, and until recently, were primarily
        undertaken in the United States and Canada.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-07T15:13:30Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-07T15:13:30Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1989</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        a major explosion ripped through the Thompson Chemical Plant at Attleboro,
        Massachusetts. Monday afternoon, the Disaster Research Center decided that
        the disaster should be used primarily as a field training exercise for a two-man
        team. However, in addition to the experience aspects, it was felt that perhaps
        some valuable observations could be made in relation to two possibly unique
        aspects of this disaster. &#13;\n1. Early news reports indicated that Rhode
        Island Police and other emergency units had assisted during the emergency.

        temperatures had inundated the New England area on Monday, January 13. What,
        if any, were the problems caused by this additional environmental stress?
        Were rescue and fire fighting operations hampered?&#13;\nBy late Monday afternoon
        when the DRC team was ready to leave Columbus, the inclement weather had grounded

        Saturday, December 14, 1963 at 3:30 P.M. a break in the Baldwin&#13;\nHills
        Dam in Los Angeles sent a torrent of water onto the hillside and&#13;\nvalley
        below, causing extensive destruction in an estimated one square&#13;\nmile
        residential and business area.&#13;\nThe 292.4 million gallons of water that
        had been stored in the reservoir battered out the sides of houses and&#13;\ncompletely
        demolished many buildings; household items such as furniture&#13;\nand refrigerators
        were swept away and mud and debris were spread for&#13;\nmiles. Many residents
        who either did not hear the warnings to evacuate or&#13;\nfailed to heed them
        fled to their rooftops and other buildings and were later&#13;\nrescued by
        helicopters. Only five people were killed, but 27 other persons were injured
        enough to require hospitalization despite the extensive damage&#13;\nto both
        public and private property which ran to several million dollars.&#13;\nOn
        Sunday, December 15 at 1l:30 A.M. a three man Disaster Research&#13;\nCenter
        team arrived in Los Angeles. &#13;\nThe primary purpose of the trip was &#13;\nto
        provide the team with field experience, and thus it represented for the&#13;\nmost
        part a training exercise rather than a systematic study. Also important&#13;\nin
        the DRS's decision to send a field team to Los Angles was the&#13;\n was fact
        the disaster took place in a major metropolitan area. While most&#13;\ndisaster
        studies have involved urban areas, very few have had metropolitan&#13;\nareas
        as their chief focus. Finally, the DRC felt that a study of the Baldwin &#13;\nHills
        disaster afforded an opportunity to obtain greater insight into group&#13;\nand
        organizational problems and responses in a dam disaster occurring in&#13;\na
        domestic setting. Some observations concerning this type of disaster in a
        foreign setting were obtained from a study by the DRC of the Vaiont Dam disaster
        which occured in northeastern Italy on October 9, 1963.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-07T20:32:04Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-07T20:32:04Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1964-08-14</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1241</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Research

        March 1, 1965, an explosion occurred in an apartment house in Ville LaSalle,
        a municipality of 41,000 people seven miles southwest of Montreal, Canada.
        The blast and subsequent fire caused extensive damage, almost completely destroying
        the twenty-four apartments located in one of the three-story, U-shaped buildings,
        damaging the other structures in the project complex, forcing the residents
        to evacuate, and blowing out windows in the buildings in the surrounding blocks.
        The blast left a crater some twenty feet deep; the explosion was heard a mile
        away. Twenty-seven persons were killed with twenty-nine out of forty-eight
        injured being hospitalized. Fifteen of those killed were children. The same
        day two DRC staff members left for Montreal to conduct a general study of
        organizational response to this disaster. Although  not a community disaster
        by the center's criteria, two characteristics of the Montreal explosion suggested
        possible implications for disaster research: first, since the explosion occurred
        in Canada, there was the possibility of making general cross-cultural comparisons
        with typical responses in the United States; and secondly, because the Montreal
        disaster was comparable in some respects to the 1963 Coliseum explosion in
        Indianapolis, limited but more specific analyses of similar organizations
        under similar conditions&#13;\nwere possible.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-08T19:52:01Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-08T19:52:01Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1965-07</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1247</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Research

        at 5:30 a.m. occurred in the South Jamaica section of Queens, New York. Although
        the blast and ensuing blaze demolished nine houses and badly damaged eight

        first part of this report will deal with a description of a theoretical framework
        of organizational functioning. Such a framework is necessarily abstract since
        abstraction allows one to explore common elements in otherwise would be a
        mass of detail. It provides a focus for attention and a classification of
        observations. In addition, it allows the formulation of possible relationships
        among the various observations. In addition, it allows the formulation of
        possible relationships among the various observations. In the first chapter,
        a theory and concepts embedded in this theory are elaborated. Chapter II presents
        certain assumptions of such a theory and some of the illustrative hypotheses
        which can be derived. Chapter III presents certain field observations in the
        context of the overall theoretical model. In Chapter IV, additional material
        is presented on the operational problems of established organizations. These
        are based on field work on some 47 instances of disasters or other forms of
        community stress. These observations touch on a number of matters which are
        not&#13;\nhighlighted in the theoretical model but are important in understanding
        the functioning of such organizations. This will include a discussion of problems
        and differential adaptation of such organizations to specific stress events.

        concern of this monograph is with understanding organized activities in communities
        which experience disasters. Every year, many American communities as well
        as others in the countless countries around the world mobilize their resources
        to cope with the impact of various kinds of emergencies, including disasters.
        In particular communities, such emergencies may be almost predictable. While
        they are not anticipated in the sense that community members look forward
        to them, they do represent a somewhat repetitive experience. In other communities,
        such events are less repetitive but, when they do occur, they reveal a reality
        which makes them difficult to forget. Like every significant drama in the
        life of a community, disasters can be viewed and described in a number of
        ways. For most purposes, the common descriptions of earthquake, hurricane,
        explosion, tornado, flood, epidemic, etc, give us insight into both the cause
        and some of the consequences of a disaster agent. If we wish increased understanding,
        we can note that disaster agents, themselves, possess characteristics which
        cause variations in their consequences. For example, such agents differ in
        their frequency, predictability, controlability, cause, speed of onset, length
        of possible forewarning, duration, scope of impact as well as in their destructive
        potential. These dimensions wise might be quite different. While such classifications
        and combinations add precision, it would also add a degree of unwanted complexity
        to the following discussion. We will assume here, unless otherwise noted,
        that the physical impact of the disaster event was created by an agent which
        possessed the characteristics of little forewarning, a rapid speed of onset
        and wide&#13;\ndestructive potential. Such characteristics would best describe
        earthquakes and tornadoes. The major concern of this monograph is not in such
        characteristics of disaster agents nor in the physical consequences of impact.
        The &#13;\nprimary concern here is in the sociological impact of such agents
        and in the attempt of organized community life to come to terms with its resulting
        social disruption.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-09T23:47:01Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-09T23:47:01Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1968-09</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1250</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Research

        of public works have not been studied very extensively by social scientists.
        In over 200 studies of natural disasters summarized by the staff of the Disaster
        Research Center, there were only a handful of descriptions of the activities
        of such organizations. Yet public work departments are almost inevitably involved
        in any large-scale community emergency. There are several reasons for this
        lack of attention. First, the organization is not highly visible to the general
        public. Its personnel do not wear uniforms which stand out and its vehicles,
        even when displaying emblems, are not as conspicuous as police cars or fire
        trucks. Second, the department works with \"things,\" not \"people.\" Therefore,
        department personnel often go unnoticed as they perform their tasks. Only
        when a public facility or service breaks down, does the public works department
        become indirectly visible. Third, the organization often deals with very specific
        and highly technical engineering problems, which the general public does not
        understand and, furthermore, is unable to evaluate. Finally, many take the
        organization's responsibilities for granted. It is expected to function as
        it does in disasters. In the minds of many, this adds up to a highly invisible,
        not very colorful organization carrying out dull tasks which are not clearly
        understood by the public. Yet the role which the department plays in disasters
        is often of critical importance to the community -- preparing it for a possible
        disaster, engaging in emergency activities during the immediate post-impact
        period, and helping to restore it to a normal state. The department of public
        works (DPW)*, one of the community's largest organizations, normally has extensive
        resources and critical skills at its disposal which are necessary if the community
        is to cope successfully with a disaster.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-09T23:57:28Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-09T23:57:28Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1968-12</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1251</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Research

        in particular ways in current disaster situations in the United States. These
        ways stem from its two basic orientations, which are essentially social welfare
        and religious in nature. In turn, these orientations are the results of the
        historical development of the organization. Thus, to understand its present
        structure and functions requires an examination of the growth of the Salvation
        Army from a local group with a goal of making religious converts to its emergence
        as a complex, international organization with multiple tasks. This development
        is very briefly sketched in this chapter.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-10</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-10</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1969-12</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1256</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Research

        \ Data</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>In many ways warning can be the most
        important phase of the disaster&#13;\nresponse. Warning is thought of not
        just in terms of mechanical devices but in terms of psychological and sociological
        structures and processes. Warning is not only advance notification of the&#13;\nexistence
        of danger but also information about what can be done to prevent, avoid, or
        minimize the danger. The characteristics of&#13;\nthe disaster agent -- frequency,
        speed of onset, scope of impact,&#13;\ndestructive potential, etc. -- affect
        the warning process. Before a warning message can be issued, threat data must
        be collected,&#13;\ncollated,and evaluated. This report examines what is involved
        in&#13;\nthese processes. Multiple organizations are frequently involved in
        collecting data; thus it must be compiled. In order for this information to
        \ be useful it must be evaluated. The decision to warn and&#13;\nthe dissemination
        of the message are discussed: who is to be warned, when, how, what the message
        includes.The response to warnings of danger is also considered. Included among
        the factors influencing response are the socio-cultural framework, the historical
        setting, and the immediate ongoing social situation. The report concludes
        with a discussion of implications for nuclear catastrophe.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-10T17:53:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-10T17:53:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1970-07</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1257</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Research

        data collected on a sample of twenty-five natural &#13;\ndisasters in the
        United States during the years 1963 through&#13;\n1970 are analyzed in a summary
        of communication processes and&#13;\nproblems. Communication is defined as
        a process in which&#13;\nmessages are sent from one point to another, while
        communication&#13;\nstructure denotes the patterned relationships among parts
        linked&#13;\nin this process. Three kinds of communication structures are&#13;\nexamined.
        Internal communication refers to message transmission&#13;\nbetween points
        within single organizations; interorganizational&#13;\ncommunication involves
        messages passing between two or more&#13;\nseparate organizations; and public-to-organization
        communication&#13;\nrefers to messages received by groups from a number of
        individual&#13;\nmembers of the general public. In the discussions of each
        of&#13;\nthese three types of communication relationships, typical problems&#13;\nencountered
        in disaster situations are mentioned, the more&#13;\ncommon ways in which
        communication capability is increased and&#13;\ndemands reduced are outlined,
        and the most frequent changes in&#13;\ncommunication patterns initiated following

        Allen Barton has noted, ''a collective stress occurs when&#13;\nmany members
        of a social system fail to receive expected conditions&#13;\nof life from
        the system.\"' Common examples of extreme collective&#13;\nstress situations
        are those usually associated with floods, earthquakes,&#13;\nbombing attacks,
        riots, revolutions, and mass purges. Underlying&#13;\nthese situations and
        providing the parameters within which these&#13;\nactivities occur is the
        community context. Work done at the &#13;\nResearch Center (DRC) has isolated
        two basic community contexts:&#13;\nconsensus and dissensus. In consensus-type
        extreme situations or&#13;\ncrises, \"there is general overall agreement about
        goals and about&#13;\nwhat should be done. Consensus crisis situations are
        typically&#13;\nexemplified in most communities during and after major disasters.&#13;\nMost
        of the research at DRC has been concerned with just such situations.&#13;\nHowever,
        dissensus-type extreme crises have not been neglected. These&#13;\nlatter
        crises are marked by differences about goals and how these goals&#13;\nshould
        be realized. Dissensus crisis situations are typically exemplified&#13;\nin
        most communities during riots or civil disorders. One&#13;\nmajor value from
        the DRC viewpoint in studying these latter situations&#13;\nis the knowledge
        gained in the comparison of organizational activities&#13;\nin the two contexts.
        In this report a dissensus situation, urban civil&#13;\ndisturbance, is studied
        in the light of the activities and operations&#13;\nof one organizational
        component: fire departments. It is hoped that&#13;\nthe material presented
        may be useful in a comparison with the activities&#13;\nand operations of
        fire departments in natural disasters.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-11</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-11</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1972-11</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1260</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Research

        problem of significant magnitude. Though the underlying causes of the phenomenon
        were exceedingly complex a civil disturbance event&#13;\nbecame a distinct
        emergency for a community. For many community organizations,&#13;\nsuch as
        police and fire departments, the problems emanating from civil disturbances
        fell directly within their organizational domain&#13;\n(Warheit and Quarantelli,
        1969). For example, if the protection of life and property and the maintenance

        crises are major emergency situations for which routine&#13;\nsocial structures
        are inadequate. Crises make preservation of valued&#13;\nitems and behavior
        patterns so precarious that extraordinary social&#13;\narrangements are deemed

        decay present this possibility for gradual, if&#13;\nfar-reaching adjustments.
        Natural disasters and civil disturbances&#13;\nare different. They are crises
        which overtake a community with little&#13;\nforewarning. Their suddenness
        and intensity demand extraordinary social&#13;\nadjustments to shield communities

        cities were conducted in an effort to ascertain the conditions&#13;\nor factors
        associated with variations in the tasks, saliency and legitimacy of local
        civil defense organizations around the United States.&#13;\nAll of the cities
        were objectively subject to at least two major natural&#13;\ndisaster threats
        and half had undergone a major disaster in the last&#13;\ndecade. Data were
        obtained from key community and emergency organization&#13;\nofficials by
        way of a disaster probability rating scale, two intensive interview guides,
        and a general documentary checklist. Among the findings were the following.
        While overall disaster&#13;\nplanning by civil defense has tended to be differentiated,
        segmented,&#13;\nisolated, cyclical and spasmodic , in recent years planning
        has broadened&#13;\nto include a wide range of disaster ,agents, a lesser
        focus on nuclear&#13;\nattack, more concern with local community viability
        and increasing&#13;\ninvolvement of a greater number of organizations in community
        disaster&#13;\nplans. Currently in almost all communities there are multiple
        layers&#13;\nof planning with little consensus on disaster tasks, on organizational&#13;\nresponsibility
        and on the scope of disaster plannlng,is well as confusion&#13;\nconcerning
        the role of civil defence in such planning. Local civil defence&#13;\ndirectors
        not only differ in following a professional or a political&#13;\ncareer path,
        but also manifest a variety of behavioral styles in carrying&#13;\nout their
        roles. Local civil defense agencies tend to be ambiguously viewed as to&#13;\ntheir
        interests, structures and functions by the general public, community&#13;\ninfluentials
        and organizational officials. Civil defense agencies&#13;\nhave also evolved
        in two different ways -- some following a traditional&#13;\npath with an emphasis
        on nuclear hazards and others concerned with a&#13;\nnumber of different hazards.
        High saliency seems to be related to extensive horizontal relationships, broad
        scope of tasks and multiple hazard concerns. A number of factors undercut
        the legitimacy of civil defense organizations.&#13;\nThese include changes
        in organizational purpose, preceived&#13;\nneed for services, decline in resources,
        poor performance and changing&#13;\nsaliency of the military model. Local
        offices which have legitimacy tend&#13;\nto be in localities where there are
        persistent threats, where civil&#13;\ndefense is within the local governmental
        structure, where extensive relationships&#13;\nare maintained with other organizations,
        and where the output&#13;\nor product of the civil defense organization is
        seen as useful to other&#13;\ncommunity groups. Conditions which are most
        likely to be productive of successful local&#13;\ncivil defense involvement
        in disaster planning are that the  loca1 organization&#13;\ndevelops experience
        in handling a variety of community emergencies,&#13;\nthat municipal government
        provides a structure which accepts and legitimizes the &#13;\ncivil defense
        function, that the local civil defense director &#13;\nhas the ability to
        generate significant pre-disaster relationships among&#13;\nthose organizations
        which do become involved in emergency activities, and&#13;\nthat emergency-relevant
        resources, such as EOCs, be provided and that the&#13;\nknowledge of their
        availability is widespread throughout the community.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-11T01:56:09Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-11T01:56:09Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1975</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1263</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Research

        primary focus of this study is to focus on the response of organizations to
        crisis.  Organizations are the primary social units which respond to major
        crisis, whether at the community, national or international level.  In particular,
        two major areas of organizational functioning are singled out for attention&#13;\n--decision
        making and communication. Both of these areas point to a range of behavior
        rather than to a single entity.  Decision making involves the consideration
        of alternative outcomes, setting goals, deciding on means to chosen ends,
        etc.  One important element in the present study is that decision making is
        viewed in an environment which is uncertain.  The very notion of crisis implies
        uncertainty.  In this context of uncertainty, organizations have to make decisions
        as to the allocation of resources for the accomplishment of goals.  An integral
        part of the decision making process is communications, a process through which
        an organization sends a signal or message over a channel to another part of
        the organization (intraorganizational) or to another organization  (interorganizational).
        \ The parts which are linked in this process create a communication structure.
        Obviously, communication is an essential part of the decision making process.
        \ The intent of the study is to use the cumulative research of DRC to build
        a set of propositions concerning organizational decision making communication.
        Outline of the Report  Chapter 11 indicates the sources of materials covered
        in developing the propositions.  Chapter III discusses the types of propositions
        which were developed. (A complete list is found in the Appendix.)  Chapter
        IV discusses a reconceptualization of organized behavior in disaster which
        allows the propositions to be placed in a more realistic context.  Chapter
        V provides a conclusion.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-12</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-12</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1977-01</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1264</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Research

        on sending a team into communities immediately after they have experienced
        a major disaster (sponsored by the Office of Civil Defense), and b. The laboratory

        I briefly describes the general research projected in the original technical
        proposal to the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. The initial theoretical
        model advanced is set fourth, as well as a description of the laboratory facilities
        being used. This chapter draws heavily from an internal DRC staff memorandum
        by Drabek, a theoretical article by Drabek, Haas, Quarantelli and Dynes, and
        a descriptive brochure by Roth. The original pilot study conducted by DRC
        in the laboratory is discussed in Chapter II. Observations made of behavioral
        changes in small groups in high demand situations are reported. This chapter
        is based on much longer draft report prepared by Mrs. Elaine Hobart, a DRC
        research assistant, which is intended to be the basis for an article in a
        professional journal. Chapter III describes the major laboratory research
        conducted during the whole course of the project, a realistic simulation of
        an actual police dispatching room. Emphasis is given to the methodology of
        this unique study, although some substantive findings are also noted. This
        discussion primarily although selectively summarized the writings of Drabek
        on the study, including his dissertation, a monograph, several papers and
        two articles.  The next chapter discusses the highlights of a second major
        laboratory simulation conducted by DRC. Undertaken by Muzzy as part of his

        the time of its founding the Center as its major research objective the analyzing
        of emergency organizations and their response to, as well as prior planning
        for, large scale community emergencies, particularly where a natural disaster
        agent was involved. This focus was taken because, while there had been prior
        studies of disaster responses, they had primarily focused on the victim. Practically
        no attention had been given to the activities of the emergency organizations
        in the community, even though the actions of such groups generally determine
        the efficiency and effectiveness of the reactions in the emergency period.
        In a basic sense, this focus on organizations during the emergency period
        has continued to be the major focus in most of the studies undertaken by the
        Center.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-15T21:01:29Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-15T21:01:29Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1976-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1271</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Miscellaneous

        between persons from different cultural backgrounds is somewhat of a stress
        situation, continued all through 1968. As initially projected, the research
        is to go through five phases: (1) a pilot laboratory observational phase;

        primary focus of this study is to focus on the response of organizations to
        crises. Organizations are the primary social units which respond to major
        crises, whether at the community, national or international level. In particular,
        two major areas of organizational functioning are singled out for attention
        \ decision making and communication. Both of these areas point to a range
        of behavior rather than to a single entity. Decision making involves the consideration
        of alternative outcomes, setting&#13;\ngoals, deciding on means to chosen
        ends, etc. One important element in the present study is that decision making
        is viewed in an environment which is uncertain. The very notion of crisis
        implies uncertainty. In this context of uncertainty, organizations have to
        make decisions as to the allocation of resources for the accomplishment of
        goals. An integral part of the decision making process is, communication,
        a process through&#13;\nwhich an organization sends a signal or message over
        a channel to another part of the organization (intraorganizational) or to
        another organization (interorganizational). The parts which are linked in
        this process create a communication structure. Obviously, communication is
        an essential part of the decision making process. The intent of the study
        is to use the cumulative research of DRC to build a set of propositions concerning
        organizational decision making and communication.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-16T23:27:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-16T23:27:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1976-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1274</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Miscellaneous

        to include elements from at least three of the four categories. Most frequent
        would be (I) specific organizational planning involving a signal agent and
        a specific organization, such as the civil disturbance plan which might be
        developed by a police department or a natural disaster plan which was developed
        by a local Red Cross unit. Many of these organizations, however, have over
        the years developed a more generalized plan which they feel to be applicable
        to a wider range of agents (see II). For example, police departments may develop
        an emergency operations plan which they feel will be applicable to a wide
        variety of emergencies. Similarly, hospitals, fire departments, and other
        organizations within the community which deal with emergencies on a somewhat
        routine basis may develop a more inclusive plant to deal with diverse types

        1975, DRC was funded by the Health Resources Administration to undertake the
        first major, systematic and comparative study on the delivery of EMS in disasters.
        In the pages that follow, we summarize the resulting 28-  &#13;\nmonth study.
        In the first chapter, we present background on the historical&#13;\ndevelopment
        of EMS in this country and indicate the current status of&#13;\ndisaster EMS
        as mandated by federal legislation. In Chapter II, we examine&#13;\nprior
        research on the delivery of EMS in mass emergencies and set forth&#13;\nour
        three major research objectives, namely to come up with a description&#13;\nand
        analysis of the characteristics of, conditions for, and consequences&#13;\nof
        the delivery of EDIS in disasters. Chapter III details the theoretical&#13;\nand
        conceptual framework that guided our research. In the next chapter,&#13;\nwe
        outline the study design and analysis, indicating our field work and how&#13;\nwe
        went about analyzing the data. Three following chapters are devoted&#13;\nto
        an exposition of our major findings as to the characteristics of, conditions&#13;\nfor
        and consequences from providing EMS in mass casualty-producing situations.&#13;\nImplications
        of the empirical findings and the limitations of the study are&#13;\ndiscussed
        in Chapter IX. The concluding chapter provides  a series of recommendations
        emanating from our work for disaster EMS policy, planning,&#13;\npractice
        and research implementation. The appendices include copies of major&#13;\nfield
        instruments used, the data coding scheme employed in some of the&#13;\nquantitative
        analyses, and lists of other writings and reports resulting from&#13;\nour

        first chapter briefly outlines the objectives of the work undertaken, and&#13;\nthe

        used and the data obtained for each of the six objectives. In the&#13;\nnext
        chapter, the research accomplishments are noted with particular emphasis&#13;\non
        the work which had not been previously reported in documents produced by our&#13;\nwork.
        Some conclusions and recommendations are contained in chapter four. An&#13;\nappendix
        provides copies of some of the field instruments used.&#13;\nIt is important
        to note that in this report, the findings and conclusions&#13;\nwere drawn
        from field data gathered no later than 1974. They do not necessarily&#13;\nreflect

        And Problems: Findings And Implications From The Research Literature</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Quarantelli,

        Literature</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Study Procedure</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Objectives</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Our
        task was threefold: (1) to examine what is and is not known about&#13;\nevacuation
        in peacetime disaster situations; (2) to systematically order and organize
        the literature and other research data; and, (3) to make recommendations from
        our findings and observations.&#13;\nAbout 150 literature sources and other
        newly gathered as well as previously gathered research data were examined.
        \ An analytical model of evacuation behavior was developed positing a relationship
        between community context, threat conditions, social processes, patterns of
        behavior including the withdrawal movement, and consequences for community
        preparedness for evacuation.  Policy, planning, operational and research implications
        were derived suggesting future actions and efforts.&#13;\nOur study did find
        that we do currently have some research-based knowledge and understanding
        about evacuation phenomena in disasters.  The literature and research data
        give us a comprehension beyond common sense notions, and in fact, at times,
        the evidence suggests that citizens in general and officials in particular
        may be working with incorrect assumptions and beliefs about the phenomena.
        \ On this topic, as is true of many other matters about disaster behavior,
        mythologies and misconceptions about evacuation abound. &#13;\nFor example,
        to the extent that there are research observations, they show that the withdrawal
        movement itself usually proceeds relatively well.  The flight tends to be
        orderly, reasonable from the perspective of the evacuees, and generally effective
        in removing people from danger.  The problems with evacuation occur before
        and after the flight behavior itself.  Organizational preparations for and
        initiation of mass evacuation efforts tend to be poor.  Planning is often
        unrealistic, assumes that evacuees have to controlled and generally does not
        address the distinctive and special problem which can be involved in mass
        evacuations.  Little consideration in plans or in actuality is given to the
        fact that evacuation involves going to some area, as well as from some locality,
        and almost always returning to the original place o f departure.&#13;\nA number
        of implications and recommendations follow form our analysis of the literature
        and research data.  Thus, we argue that evacuation should be approached as
        a proactive policy matter important in itself rather than being treated primarily
        as reaction to warning activities.  In some ways, peacetime evacuation ought
        to be viewed as distinctive and separate phenomena parallel to the treatment
        of crisis relocation in the literature on wartime emergencies.  Planning might
        visualize evacuation not as an outcome, but as a flow process with different
        emergent stage involving various kinds of contingencies.  Evacuation does
        not always develop in a singular and linear path, but may involve multiple
        and disjunctive paths.  Operational activities in connection with evacuation
        must consider the full range of the patterns of behavior that are involved,
        from the warning to the withdrawal to the shelter and to the return stage.
        \ The heterogeneity of the population at different stage requires different
        organizational actions.&#13;\nWe also found that the research base about evacuation
        phenomena is not strong.  Evacuation has not been a major focus of systematic
        study, and knowledge of the phenomena is often surface and very uneven.  Theoretical
        treatments of evacuation are even fewer and less informative as a whole that
        the descriptive and case study literature which provides the bulk of the findings
        and impressions about the topic.  Priority in the future ought to be given
        to in-depth research on unexplored topics (e.g., the non-movers), little systematically
        examined areas (e.g., the shelter stage) and selected operationally important
        subjects (e.g.., the evacuation of institutionalized populations).  At a more
        theoretical level, study needs to be done on understanding the meshing of
        individual and &#13;\norganizational behavior in mass emergencies.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-24T23:54:54Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-24T23:54:54Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1980</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1283</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Miscellaneous

        which transpired in three communities upon experiencing an actual chemical
        disaster. The purpose of this publication is to provide a picture of the complexities
        involved in local disaster operations and the means by which community uncertainties.
        \ The report is written in an effort to porvide readers a \"cookbook\" approach
        to hazardous &#13;\nchemical response, That is, it is not a step-by-step algorithm
        or field manual to which responders can refer in the event of a dangerous
        chemical&#13;\nincident. Rather, it is a descriptive report aimed at illuminating
        aspects of disaster response traditionally ignored in the more technically-oriented
        body of literature.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-05-25</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-05-25</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1981-12</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1285</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Miscellaneous

        prior warning of impending disaster can save many lives and&#13;\nalleviate
        property loss. However, when a community or an area is fore-warned and the
        predicted disaster does not materialize a very negative public reaction toward
        the officials who issued can develop.  This is especially&#13;\ntrue where
        evacuation procedures are carried out.&#13;\nPrevious disaster studies have
        indicated that repeated instances of warning not followed by some&#13;\nvisible
        danger cues, result in disbelief or nonacceptance by people in general.&#13;\nAs
        in Aesop's fable, the cry, \"Wolf!\" repeated too often without subsequent
        validation ultimately produces a response of either inaction or active rejection.&#13;\n\"Note:

        paper reports on one part of a much larger study we are undertaking on looting
        in disasters. In that effort we are examining conceptual and theoretical issues
        with respect to looting, and the empirical findings about the phenomena; essentially
        we are attempting to bring together the first complete and systematic statement
        about the topic. However, in this particular report we only discuss an almost
        unexplored specific question within the larger topic, namely, who are the
        disaster victims who claim they were subjected to looting. We present some
        possible answers to the question, bring to bear through a secondary data anlysis
        some previously unexamined research results, and attempt to draw some conclusions
        from our exercise.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-01T17:03:14Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-01T17:03:14Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1984-08</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        is an ongoing activity. This is the message of my topic today.&#13;\nWhat
        does disaster planning mean to you as a computer center manager? Does it mean
        hiring a consultant to produce a written disaster plan per se? Does it bring
        to mind the drafting of standard operating procedure manuals to handle service
        interruptions? Is it a booklet put together to satisfy a regulation or to
        convince your insurance company that you deserve a lower rate? Is it simply
        a phone list? If you are thinking along these lines, you may be in for a surprise.
        Disaster planning involves much more than this.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-01T17:19:34Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-01T17:19:34Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1989-03</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        the Center for Applied Social Research (CISA) at the University of Puerto
        Rico-Mayag\xFCez, and at the University of Massachusetts are conducting a
        research project focusing on the knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes of
        end-users (primarily emergency managers and representatives from the National
        Weather Service \u2013 NWS) in the State of Oklahoma regarding severe weather

        attention has also been paid to the advantages, problems, and limitations
        of current weather technology from the emergency manager\u2019s perspective.
        This research brief focuses on the end-users\u2019 recommendations regarding
        the allocation of the new radar resources that are being developed by the
        Engineering Research Center (ERC) on the Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of
        the Atmosphere (CASA), which is funded by the National Science Foundation
        (NSF).&#13;\n&#13;\nIn-depth interviews were conducted with members (n=38)
        of the emergency management community and NWS meteorologists with diverse
        experiences in disaster mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery.
        Based on the results from the in-depth interviews, we generated seven (7)
        broad categories that include the recommendations or factors that emergency
        managers reported should be taken into account in the allocation of radar
        resources, including a) nature of the hazard event, b) potential impact and
        outcomes of the hazard event, c) lead time, d) false alarm rates, e) population

        Accidents Involving Hazardous Chemicals Versus Those Involving Dangerous Nuclear

        accidents</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>hazardous chemicals</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>nuclear
        material</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>In this chapter we focus on transportation
        accidents which involve hazardous chemicals and those which involve dangerous
        nuclear material. The chapter is organized into four sections. In the first
        section, we address the general kinds of risks to people and things which
        are inherent in the transport of dangerous nuclear material, especially spent
        fuel.&#13;\nIn the absence of a meaningful data base of actual and past incidents,
        we must posit a hypothetical, future worst-case scenario for the analytical&#13;\npurposes
        required by the projected comparison. In the second section of the chapter
        we briefly examine the complete range of possible incidents of chemical hazards
        in transportation accidents. We observe at this point that hazardous chemicals
        are far more heterogenous in their potential and, in the extreme case, can
        be far more dangerous than the risks posed by the worst-case nuclear danger
        scenario we use. The third section of the chapter is devoted to a discussion
        of the common and unique functions relating to private and public sector preparations
        for and responses to both kinds of transportation hazards, as they have been
        reported in the speculative and research literature.  Our general finding
        is that two kinds of dangers discussed require somewhat different rather than
        similar responses. We conclude the chapter with a summary of policy implications
        for emergency management derived from the functional comparison of the nuclear
        and nonnuclear hazards discussed in the preceding section. The major conclusion
        is that despite dissimilarities in the two threats, the existing literature
        appears to overemphasize technical problems and safe-guarding measures, and
        to underemphasize social organizational weaknesses in preparing for and responding
        to transportation accidents regarding both nuclear and nonnuclear hazards.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-02T21:22:29Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-02T21:22:29Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1982</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1299</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Miscellaneous

        study was initiated because early reports and comments from the scene suggested
        that elements of a nuclear plant disaster plan might have been used in the
        evacuation. As our on-the-scene field work found, this was not the case in
        any meanginful sense, and only very indirectly did prior&#13;\nplanning for
        the nuclear plant influence the response pattern of the local emergency organizations.
        However, our study did find, as other researchers have consistently found,
        that disaster planning of any kind--and there was&#13;\nmuch disaster planning
        in the threatened area--makes a difference during a community threat emergency.
        Furthermore, it seemed particularly worthwhile to document this particular
        case because of the high disaster risk nature of the community involved, its
        extensive experience with small and&#13;\nlarge scale emergencies, and the
        complexity of its disaster planning.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-02T21:48:15Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-02T21:48:15Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1983-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1301</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Miscellaneous

        goal of this study is to examine the operations&#13;\nof local mass media
        organizations during the impact period of disasters. Eight organizational
        dimensions related to the structuring and processing of news are examined.
        These&#13;\ndimensions include 1) gatekeeping, 2) decision making, 3)the role
        of technology, 4)reporter autonomy, 5) the role of press conferences and press
        releases, 6) sources, 7) the role of television, radio and newspaper, 8) the
        sharing of&#13;\ninformation. Normal, non-disaster patterns related to these
        eight dimensions are compared with their patterns during the emergency period.
        Changes from the normal structure and process are noted. An elaborate case
        study of the local media outlets in one community is constructed. Findings
        from this case are discussed and placed within the context of research literature.
        These findings are then compared with data from local media outlets in five

        in the other communities. The study suggests that community and  organizational
        size have a substantial effect upon media operations during disasters.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-02T22:40:03Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-02T22:40:03Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1987</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1304</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Miscellaneous

        following references were compiled to provide interested&#13;\nparties with
        sources of social science research on preparing for&#13;\nand managing hazardous
        material disasters. Work of this kind has&#13;\nbeen going on since the 1950s,
        although it has accelerated&#13;\nconsiderably in the last decade. Out of
        the now rather voluminous&#13;\nliterature, we have selected out a range of
        publications that illustrate the work that has been done. Major criteria for
        selection were the intrinsic social science&#13;\nmerit of the publication
        as well as its possible interest to as&#13;\nmany relevant professional and
        scientific audiences as possible.&#13;\nPreference was also given to writings
        based on empirical research,&#13;\nand those dealing with disasters rather
        than just emergencies. The&#13;\nolder literature is cited as well as the
        more recent work. While&#13;\nall the items listed are in the English language,
        an effort was&#13;\nmade to include studies done outside of the North American&#13;\ncontinent.
        Publications on both fixed sites and transportation&#13;\naccidents involving
        hazardous materials are included. An effort&#13;\nwas also made to insure
        that publications on all phases of&#13;\nplanning for hazardous materials
        disasters are represented,&#13;\nincluding mitigation and prevention, emergency
        preparedness,&#13;\nemergency response, and recovery. However, references
        solely to wartime situations are not provided.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-03T13:05:54Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-03T13:05:54Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1992</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1307</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Miscellaneous

        produced in Japan; (2) A list of 39 English language writings by Japanese

        material from the first list, but there is also original material; (3) A list
        of 16 non-social science but disaster relevant sources which would be of value
        for anyone planning to do field work on Japanese disasters. English language
        translations are provided for the Japanese titles which are only a fraction
        of this kind of literature available. The second section of the inventory
        provides information and an abstract of the 62 Japanese publications in the
        first list. For each empirical report the following is presented: title, author(s),
        publisher and year, type of disaster agent, date of occurrence, location of
        event, casualties and damage in the situation, date of study and methodology

        technological factors. The other is on the new strategies and on the better&#13;\napplication
        of valid planning and managing principles that ought to be used to cope with
        disasters. As such, those&#13;\nofficials active in disaster planning and
        managing are visualized as prime users of this work. However, readers also
        in&#13;\nresearch aspects might also be interested. The latter in particular
        might want to look at a paper developed at the same&#13;\ntime as the initial
        draft of this volume, which focuses on conceptual and statistical problems
        involved in study disaster&#13;\nphenomena (Quarantelli 2001a).</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-06T17:05:22Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-06T17:05:22Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2003</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1312</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Miscellaneous

        is the plan to coordinate domestic and foreign&#13;\npost-earthquake investigations
        supported by the National&#13;\nEarthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP).
        The plan&#13;\naddresses coordination of both the NEHRP agencies-Federal&#13;\nEmergency
        Management Agency (FEMA), National&#13;\nInstitute of Standards and Technology
        (NIST), National&#13;\nScience Foundation (NSF), and U. S. Geological Survey&#13;\n(USGS)-
        and their partners. The plan is a framework for&#13;\nboth coordinating what
        is going to be done and identifying&#13;\nresponsibilities for post-earthquake
        investigations. It does not&#13;\nspecify what will be done. Coordination
        is addressed in various&#13;\ntime frames ranging from hours to years after
        an earthquake.&#13;\nThe plan includes measures for (1) gaining rapid and&#13;\ngeneral
        agreement on high-priority research opportunities,&#13;\nand (2) conducting
        the data gathering and field studies in a&#13;\ncoordinated manner. It deals
        with identification, collection,&#13;\nprocessing,processing, documentation,
        archiving, and dissemination of&#13;\nthe results of post-earthquake work
        in a timely manner and&#13;\neasily accessible format.&#13;\nFor the purposes
        of this plan a significant domestic earthquake&#13;\nis defined as either
        (1) an earthquake resulting in a Presidential&#13;\ndisaster declaration,
        or (2) an earthquake considered&#13;\nby NEHRP agencies to provide an opportunity
        to learn how to&#13;\nreduce future earthquake losses in the United States.
        The plan&#13;\norganizes domestic post-earthquake investigation and information&#13;\ndissemination
        activities into three phases, which include&#13;\nthe following elements:</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-06T17:52:18Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-06T17:52:18Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2003</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1313</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Miscellaneous

        in each of three countries&#13;\nItaly, Japan, and the United States, in this
        effort to understand&#13;\nthe effect of societal context on the manner in
        which natural disaster&#13;\nresponse functions are performed. The study of
        these nations&#13;\nis approached from an institutional/structural perspective
        in which&#13;\ndemographic, economic, political, communication, family, and
        religious&#13;\nvariables are examined as they affect the warning, emergency
        preparedness,&#13;\nevacuation, inventory, victim care, security, welfare,
        and emergency&#13;\nrestoration of services functions of disaster response.
        The&#13;\ngeneral nature of the study is exploratory, and, while some attention&#13;\nis
        given to all the institutional/structural variables listed, there&#13;\nis
        particular emphasis placed on the degree of political centralization&#13;\nas
        an independent variable. In terms of the relationships&#13;\nbetween institutional/structural
        variables and the performance of&#13;\ndisaster functions, the following questions
        were asked: How were&#13;\nthe functions carried out? Where did the functions
        take place,&#13;\ni.e., the geographical location of the activity? Who were
        the individuals, groups, and organizations involved in the activities?&#13;\nWhat
        difficulties were encountered? The following questions about&#13;\nthe impact
        of political centralization on disaster response, guided&#13;\nthe research:
        At what levels of government are key decisions made?&#13;\nDoes the level
        of decision making vary according to normal times&#13;\nversus disaster periods
        and/or the area, subject and content of&#13;\nmatters being decided, and/or
        policy decisions versus operational decisions? Is there a different pattern
        of decision making in&#13;\ndisaster response functions in a decentralized
        nation as contrasted&#13;\nto a centralized nation?</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-06T19:08:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-06T19:08:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1977</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1314</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Historical

        Activities</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>In the early morning hours of Saturday,
        November 23, 1963, a fire completely obliterated the Golden Age Nursing Home
        in Fitchville, Ohio, killed 63 patients and routed 21 others plus a night
        staff of three attendants. Four firemen were injured in fighting the blaze.
        Only one other nursing home fire in the history of the country resulted in
        more victims. In terms of its spatial impact, the event clearly was not a
        community disaster. Still, it seemed to the Disaster Research Center that
        at least on a descriptive level something could be learned in this situation
        about: I. Disaster responses in an institutional setting; and 2. Organizational
        reactions to disasters in a non-urban area. However, the basic purpose of
        the field trip was to give members of the DRC staff further experience in
        an actual disaster situation. Thus, the description below is the by-product
        of a training mission and should be treated as such. On the afternoon of the
        fire, two research assistants of the DRC arrived in the area to observe the
        activities of organizations in this crisis. After visiting the site of the
        fire Saturday evening, they spent Sunday informally interviewing about a dozen
        individuals associated with the disaster involved agencies. An attempt was
        made to interview personnel in each principle organization that participated
        in the emergency operations. Among those members of the local sheriff\u2019s
        department, State Highway Patrol, and Salvation Army, as well as volunteer
        firemen.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-07T22:52:02Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-07T22:52:02Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1964-08-03</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1317</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Research

        the earliest work undertaken by the Disaster Research Center&#13;\n(DRC) was
        a series of field studies on warnings in connection with&#13;\nfloods in ten
        different communities in Colorado in June 1965. For a&#13;\nvariety of reasons
        no public report on the research was ever issued.&#13;\nA limited circulation
        working paper describing some of the research&#13;\nwas written in 1968. This
        version was modified by the late Benjamin&#13;\nF, McLuckie in 1971 but was
        kept in working paper form. However,&#13;\nthe initiation of the DRC Historical
        and Comparative Disasters series&#13;\nin 1977 offered an opportunity to bring
        the work to a larger audience,&#13;\nAccordingly, Marti F. Worth of the DRC
        staff went back to the original&#13;\ninterview data in the files to rewrite,
        extend and update the two earlier&#13;\nversions. This volume is a product
        of that effort, and, thus, a study&#13;\nof over a decade ago now becomes
        fully available.The decision to publish the results of research conducted
        some time&#13;\nback was partly dictated by two factors. First, even at the
        present&#13;\ntime most studies focus on only one disaster impacted community;
        in&#13;\nin this instance ten different communities were studied comparatively&#13;\nin
        connection with the same general disaster and in the same way.&#13;\nSecond,
        while a number of very good studies of warning have been undertaken&#13;\nin
        the disaster area, few have concentrated on the organizational&#13;\naspects
        of the warning process as did the DRC Colorado study. Thus, at this time this
        report of a study conducted in 1965 seems warranted.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-07T23:25:55Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-07T23:25:55Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1977</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1319</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Historical

        And Problems Of The Local Red Cross Disaster Relief In The 1960s</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Adams,

        Relationships</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Natural Disaster</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>In
        a disaster of any magnitude that occurs in American society, the&#13;\nRed
        Cross is certain to be present. Much of the mass care which is necessary during
        such emergencies becomes the responsibility of the Red Cross. Too,&#13;\nunlike
        other emergency organizations, the Red Cross has continuing responsibilities
        in the rehabilitation phase. Because of such extensive involvement&#13;\nin
        disaster activities, only a limited aspect of this involvement can be considered&#13;\nhere.
        The concern here is to depict the operations of this organization&#13;\nduring
        the emergency period -- the nature of the problems it encounters&#13;\nand
        the possible organizational sources of the difficulties it may have in&#13;\ncarrying
        out it activities. In this sense, the report is problem oriented rather than
        concentrating on achievements.&#13;\nWhile the focus of the report will be
        on the local chapter of the Red&#13;\nCross in its disaster activities, these
        local activities have to be seen in&#13;\nthe context of their relationship
        to national level policy and to Red Cross personnel based outside the community.
        Consequently, after a brief discussion&#13;\nof the data upon which this report
        is based, attention will be given to the&#13;\ngeneral structure of the Red
        Cross. In the second chapter, the disaster&#13;\norientation of the Red Cross
        is outlined, particularly as this orientation is&#13;\nrevealed in the emergency
        demands which the organization accepts as legitimate.&#13;\nThe bulk of this
        second chapter, therefore, concerns the tasks which members&#13;\nof the Red
        Cross perform in disaster.&#13;\n Subsequent chapters will consider the Red
        Gross mobilization of personnel&#13;\nand supplies to perform these tasks
        in emergencies (chapter three) and certain&#13;\nproblems which occur within
        the organization as a result of this mobilization&#13;\n(chapter four). One
        of the consequences of mobilization is, of course, the&#13;\nsudden convergence
        of national personnel and local volunteers on the Red Cross.&#13;\nChapter

        Hurricane Betsy, the Disaster rsearch Center undertook an&#13;\nintensive
        study of some of the organizational responses in the New Orleans&#13;\narea.
        From the data gathered in field work, a working paper was prepared&#13;\nseveral
        years later. This was never publicly circulated beyond DRC because&#13;\nit
        was intended to be but the first of two or three other extensive case&#13;\nstudies
        which were to be part of a comparative analysis of community organizational&#13;\nresponse
        to major disaster. For a variety of reasons the other&#13;\ncase studies were
        never written. However, the New Orleans case study, even&#13;\nat the present
        time, still is one of the more detailed ones existing in&#13;\ndisaster literature.
        It is, therefore, now being published in more public&#13;\nform, so disaster
        researchers and historians will have easier access to the&#13;\nmaterial.
        The present version is almost identical to the original working&#13;\npaper
        except for some minor editing and limited bibliographical updating. As&#13;\nsuch,
        time reference to the organizations and actions described in the monograph&#13;\nrefer
        to the year 1965 when the hurricane hit Louisiana. Structure&#13;\nand function
        of such groups as local Red Cross chapters and civil defense&#13;\nhave changed
        somewhat in the ensuing decade.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-08T20:54:59Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-08T20:54:59Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1979</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1321</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Historical

        Colleges</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Campus Tensions</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>In
        recent years, and more specifically last spring, attention has&#13;\nfocused
        on what was happening on the campuses of Ohio colleges and universities.&#13;\nThis
        attention, however, has not been on the real accomplishments&#13;\nof these
        campuses -- in providing an education for hundreds of&#13;\nthousands of students
        from Ohio, the other 49 states, and from almost&#13;\nevery country in the
        world -- but on campus disruption and destruction.&#13;\nCertainly, the events
        at Kent State University brought home to Ohioans ,&#13;\nas well as people
        all over the world, the real and the symbolic tragedy of campus disturbances.
        The aftermath has brought on charges and recriminations, but perhaps less
        careful reflection as to the meaning of the&#13;\nevents. In raising questions
        about these images, we indicate what we wish&#13;\nto do throughout this report
        -- to raise questions. In the aftermath of&#13;\nSpring, 1970, many persons
        have answers and solutions but they are often&#13;\nin response to the wrong
        questions. We wish to reverse the procedure&#13;\nhere. We do not begin with
        solutions because the first step is to obtain factual information on what
        actually did happen on Ohio campuses in&#13;\nthe spring. In Part I, we will
        present a summary table which will provide&#13;\ninformation as to the range
        and scope of activity which occurred on&#13;\nOhio campuses in the spring.
        There is great diversity in what went on.&#13;\nWe have chosen illustrations
        to emphasize that diversity. These are represented by case studies of the
        activities on several campuses.&#13;\nSince these are descriptive and lengthy,
        the reader may wish to sample&#13;\nthis section (Appendix I) before going
        on. Understanding what happened&#13;\nin Ohio requires an understanding of
        the context of student unrest and&#13;\ndisruption all over the world, but
        particularly in the United States.&#13;\nWhile Ohio is unique, this does not
        imply that we cannot learn from what&#13;\nis happening elsewhere and by others.

        in Disaster Operations in the 1960's</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Warheit, George
        J.</dc:creator>\n<dc:subject>Fire Department</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>disaster-related
        tasks</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>nuclear catastrophe</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Along
        with the police department, the fire department in the United States is one
        community organization typically called upon in a crisis situation such as
        a natural/technological disaster or a riot/civil disturbance. This report
        analyzes data from fire department operations in the 1960s, both in disasters
        and civil disturbances. Thus, whatever is said is most relevant to that time
        period in American society, although it is probably true that much of what
        is reported is still applicable at the present time.&#13;\n&#13;\nThis report
        analyzes fire departments in terms of (1) their typical organizational patterns;
        (2) their disaster-related tasks and activities which are a response to the
        demands upon them; (3) their organizational adaptation to demand situations,
        especially those of high intensity; (4) their interorganizational relationships;
        and (5) their potential involvement and organizational adaptation to a postnuclear
        attack environment as this was visualized in the 1960s.&#13;\n&#13;\nThe local
        fire department perhaps changes less from its precrisis to its emergency time
        operations than any other community organization. Fire departments are likely
        to continue to cope with tasks similar to their preimpact responsibilities.
        They are organizations that retain a great deal of autonomy both in disasters
        and civil disturbances since their specialized tasks can seldom be preempted
        by other groups or agencies. They are organized to deal with crises, for example,
        by having a reserve force on call at all times, or by having mutual aid pacts
        with other departments. Also, the extent to which fire organizations can change
        is limited by state laws and regulatory codes of agencies such as the American
        Insurance Association.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-09T23:11:25Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-09T23:11:25Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1996</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1324</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Historical

        do large-scale disasters produce such mentally healthy conditions? What therapeutic
        principles can we derive from a study of the natural human adjustments that
        develop among disaster survivors?&#13;\n&#13;\nThose are the central questions
        addressed in the paper that follows-a paper whose content is exactly as it
        was written in 1961. Those questions appeared rather strange to readers at
        that time, especially among people who had never personally experienced a
        large-scale disaster or who had not conducted considerable field research
        in actual community or societal disasters.  Even today, many people are likely
        to reject these questions as incredible because they believe that the deaths,
        injuries, physical destruction, and personal deprivations caused by disasters
        must inevitably produce pathological personal and social consequences.&#13;\n&#13;\nBecause
        my emphasis in this paper focuses attention on the positive, beneficent, and
        therapeutic personal and social effects of disaster, it may be helpful to
        trace the history by which I arrived at this contrary perspective. The development
        of these ideas gradually emerged from personal and researched experiences
        covering a period of about 18 years \u2013 from 1943 to 1961. The specific
        events and experiences cover five different periods:</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-09T23:54:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-09T23:54:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1996</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1325</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Historical

        physical features of disasters, but primarily in their human and social aspects.
        We have several contracts: one with the Office of Civil Defense, which supports
        most of our field work, and another with the Office of Scientific Research
        of the Air force, which supports what we call the laboratory part of our research.
        Those were our initial contracts and are still our two basic contracts as
        of today.  Essentially, they call for us to study organizational functioning
        under stress. That is, were are not interested in victims themselves; rather,
        our basic objective is to study organizations and their personnel, particularly
        those that get involved in solving the community problems engendered by disaster.
        This would include such groups as police and fire departments, civil defense,
        mass media, hospital, etc.  We are not confined to them alone, although they
        were our initial focus and are still the major point of interest in our research.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-09T23:55:10Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-09T23:55:10Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1998</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1326</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Historical

        study examines transnational interaction between Canadian and American organizations
        during their response to the 1997 Red River flood. In particular, the research
        focuses on: 1) the direction and degree of dependency organizations had on
        their cross-border counterparts for information and response implementation;
        2) the use of formal and informal processes in transnational decision-making
        and&#13;\ncommunication; 3) the extent to which standardization inconsistencies
        affected the disaster response; 4) whether or not transnational interaction
        occurred primarily between centralized emergency organizations or decentralized
        agencies involved in flood-fighting efforts. The analysis uses a grounded
        theory examination of cross-border agreements, agency and governmental reports,
        newspapers, and interviews conducted with sixty-two key representatives from
        principle Canadian and American organizations involved in the flood response.
        The study describes the nature and frequency of the interaction. It finds
        that although several problems or areas of cohesion developed, transnational
        interaction between organizations during the 1997 flood was generally successful,
        with respondents reporting satisfaction with the willingness and ability of
        their counterparts to provide information and assistance. The research also
        identifies ways in which cross-border interaction can be expanded and issues
        that should be considered before such implementation occurs. Recommendations
        are listed below in the order that they are discussed in the body of the text.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-09T23:55:31Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-09T23:55:31Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2000</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1327</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Historical

        everyday speech, the word \"emergency\" usually signifies a&#13;\nsudden and
        unexpected condition calling for immediate action. In&#13;\nthe last four
        decades, social scientists starting from popular&#13;\nusages of the term,
        have increasingly attempted to conceptualize&#13;\nemergency as part of the
        social situation generated by natural&#13;\nand technological disasters or
        catastrophes. In fact, to a considerable&#13;\nextent, the theoretical work
        and empirical research on&#13;\nthe social aspects of disasters is the equivalent
        of the social&#13;\nscientific analysis and study of emergencies. Actually
        whether&#13;\nthe term \"disaster\", \"catastrophe\" or \"emergency\" is primarily&#13;\nused,
        seems to depend on the particular language involved. For&#13;\nexample, Italian
        social scientists have somewhat preferred to use&#13;\nthe term \"emergency\"
        whereas Americans have been inclined to&#13;\nemploy the word \"disaster\"
        even though the substantive phenomena&#13;\n-being discussed is about the
        same in both cases. However, since&#13;\nmost of the social scientific literature
        what exists in the area&#13;\nuses \"disaster\" rather than \"emergency\"
        or \"catastrophe\", we will&#13;\nin this article mostly but not exclusively
        use the first term. Part of this tendency and also lack of complete consensus
        can be&#13;\nattributed to the fact that social science studies in the area&#13;\nare
        but about four decades old, and until recently, were&#13;\nprimarily undertaken
        in the United States.&#13;\nConsequently, we will first generally describe
        the sociohistorical&#13;\ndevelopment of this area of study. Then the various&#13;\nconceptualizations
        advanced of the key term, disaster, are&#13;\ndiscussed. This is followed
        by an overview of major research&#13;\ncodification efforts made up to the
        present and then selected but&#13;\nimportant substantive research findings
        are summarized. We&#13;\nconclude with a brief statement about the general
        applicability&#13;\nof findings across all societies, and end with a projection
        of studies needed in the future.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-10T14:52:34Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-10T14:52:34Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1990</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1328</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Response</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>The following research brief uses data
        obtained from twenty six (n=26) interviews with emergency managers, National
        Weather Service (NWS) forecasters, and amateur radio operators (HAM) to determine
        whether rainfall estimation or tornado detection would more effectively address
        the needs of the emergency management community in Oklahoma. This study was
        conducted as part of a broader project on end-user integration, which intends
        to incorporate the needs and recommendations of end users into the design
        of radar technology currently under development by the Engineering Center
        for the Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA). In the course
        of our analysis, we discovered that a majority of emergency managers require
        tornado detection due to the specific needs of Oklahoma communities, as well
        as their experiences with severe weather. We identified three reasons for
        this decision. First, tornados are less predictable than floods. Second, mitigation
        strategies, such as rain gauges and retention ponds, have significantly reduced
        the threat of flooding in most regions. Finally, failed tornado warnings vis-a-vis
        flood warnings seem to pose a greater threat to professional credibility and
        legitimacy. Overall, these findings indicate that emergency managers consider
        a wide range of factors when making decisions related to severe weather. While
        much is revealed about the decision-making process, the reasons for which
        emergency managers chose tornado detection over rainfall estimation were,
        in some cases, based on incomplete or inaccurate information. Most strikingly,
        for example, is that according to epidemiological statistics, flooding appears
        to be a greater threat to life than tornados. Moreover, current flood mitigation
        practices do not address the fact that a) floods produce long-term and diffuse
        effects (e.g. insurance costs), and b) mitigation techniques may decrease
        the level of individual preparedness, putting a population at risk of flash
        and/or major flooding. It is the recommendation of emergency managers that
        radar resources should primarily be allocated to tornado detection. It should,
        however, be remembered that flooding may continue to constitute a major threat
        to these communities.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-13T14:09:38Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-13T14:09:38Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1329</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        consisting of private citizens who were informally or formally organized at

        This indicates that our interest lies only in relatively recent private&#13;\ncitizen

        extra-community oriented groups (whether at a&#13;\nregional, state, or national

        a disaster and not those which&#13;\nemerge during the emergency the period,

        other words or labels which are used, do not  quite seem to be always pointing
        to the same thing. Those that use reconstruction seem to stress the physical
        aspects of a postdisaster situation, but for social scientists that probably
        is not the important dimension to consider.&#13;\nRestoration appears to be
        a statement about going back to previous patterns, which however most would
        think should be a matter of empirical determination, not of definition. The
        term recovery often seems to be imply that everything worked out fine after

        earlier article discussing the initial days of disaster studies noted that
        the roots of the area in the applied concerns of research funders led to a
        pattern of how research was done and what was studied that still prevails
        today. However, this paper stresses that a certain sociological orientation
        and particular sociological ideas implicitly came to permeate much of the
        early work and many of the observations and findings made.&#13;\nWe also indicate
        that the research approach, initiated with a mixture of applied concerns and
        basic sociological questions, has had up to now primarily functional consequences
        on the development of the field of study of disasters. But the paper concludes
        with a statement that the field currently needs a fundamental reconceptualization
        of disaster. It is argued that the impetus for that is more likely to come
        out of a questioning of basic ideas as well as the growing internationalization

        report is&#13;\nto illustrate how Delawareans rate various health care providers
        and report on their specific experiences with&#13;\nthe health care system\u2014presenting
        summary results from the 2003 Delaware CAHPS study. The CAHPS&#13;\nsurvey
        instrument is a useful guide to policymakers seeking to improve both Delaware\u2019s
        health plans and the&#13;\nhealth care providers deliver to patients. It is
        the intent of this report to supply the relevant stakeholders and&#13;\npolicymakers
        with objective, experience-based information regarding the quality of health
        care provided in&#13;\nDelaware. Equipped with three years of survey data
        (2001-2003), we generate comparisons of Delaware to&#13;\nnational data benchmarks.
        We also discuss overall ratings and experiences with care within Delaware,
        health&#13;\nplan enrollment characteristics, and differences across plan
        types and regions.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-06-28T16:36:16Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-28T16:36:16Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-06-28T16:36:16Z</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1347</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n</oai_dc:dc>\n</metadata>\n

        communities are struck by disasters, their ability to respond effectively
        is related to two general factors: emergency preparedness and response planning;
        and the resource capacity available to put those plans into effect.  A large
        body of literature and research exists that illustrate how these two factors
        are interrelated, especially at the local level, in determining the community's
        ability to deal with disaster situations, whether unexpected or anticipated.
        \ Much of this research has focused on the functioning of emergency response
        organization (such as the local emergency management agency, fire and police
        departments, the Red Cross, and emergency medical services) following a disaster.&#13;\n
        \    Almost no attention, however, has been given to the emergency preparedness
        of lifeline organizations (such as power systems, communication systems, water
        and sewerage systems, transportation systems, and public works departments).</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-07-01T19:50:13Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-07-01T19:50:13Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1990</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1349</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        theory</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Serum albumin is an especially reactive
        molecule, binding both positive and negative small ions, organic molecules,
        and even neutral molecules. As such, its role in blood biochemistry is important
        and pervasive. This Memorandum examines the role of serum albumin with respect
        to the binding of H+, C1- and Ca++.&#13;\n&#13;\nThe point of view, following
        much of the literature, is that the Linderstrom-Lang theory--which treats
        the molecule as a charged sphere--can explain the anomalous behavior of serum
        albumin in acidity region remote from the isoionic point. But is shown, first
        for H+ and then for C1- and a++, that while the charged sphere concept can
        be stretched to fit the laboratory data, the consequent Debye-Huckel parameter
        bears little relation to the predicted values.&#13;\n&#13;\nThe fairly exact
        calculations of simultaneous events&#13;\npossible with the computer leaves
        little room for doubt&#13;\nthat a much improved theory must be developed.
        In fact,&#13;\none conclusion is that this theory is only approximate&#13;\nand
        that an adequate explanation probably will have to&#13;\nbegin with the exact
        geometry of the molecule and the&#13;\nconsequent intramolecular interactions.
        This latter procedure is almost possible today--with increasing knowledge
        of molecular structure--whereas it was not when&#13;\nthe farmer theory was
        promulgated.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-07-07T23:30:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-07-07T23:30:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1967-04</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1356</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>RM-5254-PR</dc:relation>\n<dc:publisher>RAND

        problem identification, research and management in the Great Lakes Basin&#13;\nadvocated
        by the Board in its 1977 Annual Report.This ecosystem approach is based on
        a man-in-a-system concept rather&#13;\nthan on the system-external-to-man
        concept inherent in the 1972 Great Lakes&#13;\nWater Quality Agreement.Incorporation
        of this approach within the advisory and management functions of the Commission
        and Parties, respectively, necessitates&#13;\npolitical recognition of the
        Great Lakes Basin as an Ecosystem&#13;\ncomposed of the interacting elements
        of water, air, land and living organisms,&#13;\nincluding man, within the
        Basin. It further necessitates explicit recognition&#13;\nof exchange of materials
        such as atmospheric pollutants into and out of the&#13;\nBasin, in biospheric
        perspective. The ecosystem approach provides the philosophic&#13;\nbasis for
        a view of man as part of nature. It directs the efforts of&#13;\nthe Parties
        and the Commission toward treatment of the patient (the Ecosystem)&#13;\nrather

        normal human blood biochemistry to the problem&#13;\nof simulating the unique
        blood of certain clinical&#13;\npatients. This Memorandum reviews only briefly
        the earlier&#13;\nmethods for the steady-state simulation of large biochemical&#13;\nsystems,
        and then adapts the basic concepts to the problem&#13;\nof automatically modeling
        the unique blood of an individual.&#13;\nThe procedures and algorithms are
        discussed, and, in particular,&#13;\nit is shown that given sufficient laboratory
        data&#13;\na unique model can automatically be defined.&#13;\nIn thirty separate
        laboratory experiments, a model of&#13;\nindividual blood was obtained and
        tested against the real&#13;\nblood in vitro, under various chemical stresses.
        Results indicate satisfactory agreement except in cases where time dependent&#13;\nor
        kinetic parameters are involved as in potassiumion&#13;\nuptake by the cells.
        These results have encouraged the&#13;\nbelief that with subsequent improvement,
        in particular,&#13;\ndevelopment of procedures based upon minimal data, modeling&#13;\nprocedures
        will be applicable and useful in a clinical&#13;\nsetting.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-07-13T20:08:29Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-07-13T20:08:29Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1970-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        Runoff</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Wet Weather Water Quality  Criteria</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>The
        projected costs for treating CSO and urban runoff nationwide are&#13;\nextremely
        large, and therefore necessitates that methods be available to&#13;\nquantitatively
        evaluate the receiving water impacts associated with these discharges. This
        progress report summarizes the results of the first year's&#13;\neffort on
        investigating methods which can be &#13;\nemployed to develop wet weather
        standards. The wet weather criteria could ultimately be employed to develop
        measures of benefits to be obtained from treatment of CSO and urban runoff.
        This project considers short-term water quality impacts that occur during&#13;\nor
        shortly after a storm event. Examples of the short term impacts are dissolved
        oxygen depressions due to rapid oxidation of contaminants or the death&#13;\nof
        fish as a result of short term increases in the concentration of a toxic&#13;\nin
        the receiving water. The phenomenon which characterize these impacts&#13;\nare
        related to event characteristics such as the volume and duration of the&#13;\nrunoff,
        the concentration of a contaminant in the runoff, and the dilution&#13;\navailable
        in the receiving water during the runoff event. This dilution can&#13;\nbe
        characterized, on the scale of the total river width, by the joint occurrence&#13;\nof
        storm discharges from urban areas and the stream flow in the receiving&#13;\nwaters.
        A second area of investigation in the project addresses&#13;\nmethods for
        defining the effects of time variable concentrations on organism&#13;\nmorality
        and includes considerations of carryover effects between storms as&#13;\na
        result of varying instream contaminant oncentrations during dry weather.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-07-15T19:02:17Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-07-15T19:02:17Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1900</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        age-dependent food chain model that considers species bioenergetics&#13;\nand
        toxicant exposure through water and food is developed. It is successfully&#13;\napplied
        to PCB contamination of the Lake Michigan lake trout food chain&#13;\nrepresented
        by phytoplankton, Mysis, alewife, and lake trout. The model indicates&#13;\nthat
        for the top predator lake trout, PCB exposure through the food&#13;\nchain
        can account for greater than 99 percent of the observed body burden. A&#13;\nsimple
        steady-state computation indicates that ratios of chemical concentration&#13;\nin
        predators to that in prey in feeding experiments may be as low as 0.2&#13;\nand
        still result in significant food chain transfer. It is estimated that a criterion
        specifying that PCB concentrations of&#13;\nall ages of lake trout be at or
        below 5 ug/g (wet weight) in the edible portion&#13;\nwould require that dissolved
        PCB concentrations be reduced to somewhere&#13;\nbetween 0.5 and 2.5 ug/R.
        The range reflects uncertainty in the PCB assimilation&#13;\nefficiency of
        the species and the dissolved PCB concentration. This report was submitted

        Classically, the&#13;\nmacroscopic features of healthy blood--the principal
        fluid&#13;\nand electrolyte distributions--can be said to be in a&#13;\nhemostatic
        steady state under the influence of several&#13;\ninteracting constraints,
        e.g., the osmotic effects of the&#13;\nfixed proteins, the (fixed) charge
        of the proteins and&#13;\nthe neutral electrostatic charge condition, and
        the active&#13;\ncation pumps. Chapter I examines these constraints from the
        vantage of a theoretical model, and shows them to be sufficient&#13;\nexplanation
        for the steady state; whether they are&#13;\nalso necessary has not been demonstrated.&#13;\nChapter
        II considers the incorporation of the microscopic&#13;\nproperties of the
        proteins in the model, particularly&#13;\ntheir buffering behavior. This work
        is not complete, owing&#13;\nprincipally to the lack of firm data on hemoglobin.&#13;\nChapter
        III discusses the validation of the mathematical&#13;\nmodel and the consequences
        of the previous biochemical structural&#13;\ndetail, testing the model under
        various conditions--&#13;\nchanges in,gas pressure and pH, and additions of
        a few chemical stresses. It compares several validation experiments with the
        literature.  This Memorandum show that, except for certain interesting discrepancies,
        the model satisfactorily agrees with the literature.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-07-15T20:42:00Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-07-15T20:42:00Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1966-07</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        diverse character of fluvial sediments makes&#13;\nthe choice of laboratory
        analysis somewhat arbitrary&#13;\nand the processing of sediment samples difficult.
        This&#13;\nreport presents some theories and methods used by&#13;\nthe Water
        Resources Division for analysis of fluvial&#13;\nsediments to determine the
        concentration of  suspended sediments&#13;\nsamples and the particle-size
        distribution of&#13;\nboth suspended-sediment and bed-material samples.&#13;\nOther
        analyses related to these determinations may&#13;\ninclude particle shape,
        mineral content, and specific&#13;\ngravity, the organic matter and dissolved
        solids of&#13;\nsamples, and the specific weight of soils.&#13;\nThe merits
        and techniques of both the evaporation&#13;\nand filtration methods for concentration
        analysis are&#13;\ndiscussed. Methods used for particle-size analysis of&#13;\nsuspended-sediment
        samples may include the sievepipet,&#13;\nthe VA tube-pipet, or the BW tube-VA
        imbe depending&#13;\non the equipment available, the concentration&#13;\nand
        approximate size of sediment in the sample, and&#13;\nthe settling medium
        used. The choice of method for&#13;\nmost bed-material samples is usually
        limited to procedures&#13;\nsuitable for sand or to some type of visual&#13;\nanalysis
        for large sizes.&#13;\nSeveral tested forms are presented to help insure a&#13;\nwell-ordered
        system in the laboratory to handle the&#13;\nsamples, to help determine the
        kind of analysis required&#13;\nfor each, to conduct the required processes,
        and to assist in the required computations. Use of the&#13;\nmanual should
        further \u201Cstandardize\u201D methods of fluvial&#13;\nsediment analysis

        were undertaken at several stations in the&#13;\nsouthern Chesapeake Bay in
        support of the Sediment Data Monitoring Plan for the Time Variable Model.
        \ This work followed the consensus plan initially produced by the EPA sediment

        discussions held on February 5, 1988 meeting at the Baltimore District, U.S.
        Army Corps of Engineers, and discussions with officials from the EPN Chesapeake
        Bay&#13;\nProgram, HydroQual, Inc. and other scientists involved in the Chesapeake
        Bay sediment data collection program. These studies in Southern Chesapeake
        Bay were undertaken in conjunction with&#13;\nparallel studies in the Northern
        Chesapeake Bay by W.R. Boyton, W.M. Kemp and coworkers&#13;\nat the University
        of Maryland, and studies of sediment accumulation rates at all&#13;\nsites
        by G. Brush (The Johns Hopkins University). Together these data sets will

        of phytoplankton and microheterotrophs&#13;\nto the development and maintenance
        of anoxia in the mesohaline&#13;\nregion of Chesapeake Bay. A series of 14
        cruises were made from February to &#13;\nOctober, 1985, on which water quality,
        nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton&#13;\nproduction, and microheterotroph
        production and metabolism were&#13;\nassessed. Phytoplankton production from
        February to May generates a quantity of&#13;\norganic matter more than adequate
        to cause oxygen decline in mid-Bay deep&#13;\nwaters. The development of the
        summer mazimum in phytoplankton productivity &#13;\nappears to depend upon
        the regeneration of nutrients from phytoplankton&#13;\ncarbon produced in
        the spring which sinks into deep water and is remineralized&#13;\nby bacteria.
        These nutrients are recycled into the euphotic zone via &#13;\nvertical mixing
        and oscillations of the pycnocline. Bacterial biomass, production, and metabolism
        are tightly coupled to&#13;\nphytoplankton production during the spring and
        summer. Phytodetritus is the&#13;\nsource of carbon fueling bacterial oxygen
        consumption in deep waters. A&#13;\nrelationship for predicting oxygen consumption
        rates from bacterial abundance&#13;\nestimates has been developed. Water column
        oxygen consumption by &#13;\nmicroheterotrophs is a major contributor to the
        development of anoxia during&#13;\nthe spring and early summer.  Microbial
        sulfur cycling then becomes an important mechanism for maintaining anoxia.
        \ The potential for the establishment of anoxia is greatest in the northern
        regions of the mesohaline Chesapeake Bay.&#13;\ngreater variation over shorter
        distances in an east to west direction.&#13;\nHowever, phytoplankton and bacteria
        parameters exhibit greater variatin over shorter distances in an  east to
        west direction.&#13;\nComparisons of biological measurements made in the summer
        of 1984, a&#13;\nhigh flow year in which anoxia was widespread, with measurements
        made in&#13;\n1985, a low flow year in which anoxia was limited and of short
        duration,&#13;\nsuggest that fundamental changes have occurred in the ecosystem
        of mid-&#13;\nChesapeake Bay such that a significant portion of primary production
        is&#13;\nchanneled into bacterial production. Thus, the severity of anoxic
        conditions depends upon climatic differences regulating freshwater flow, pycnocline&#13;\ntilting,
        and wind mixing rather than upon changes in biological parameters.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-07-21</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-07-21</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1985</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        with environmental radiological standards&#13;\npromulgated to limit routine
        releases from nuclear facilities&#13;\nis usually determined through the use
        of mathematical models which are subject to considerable uncertainty. One
        way of&#13;\nestimating the uncertainty associated with model predictions
        is through an analysis of the statistical properties of their&#13;\ninput
        parameters. This report presents results of such analyses for parameters incorporated
        in U.S. Nuclear&#13;\nRegulatory Commission (NRC) Regulatory Guide 1.109.
        Approximately 200 references are reviewed and the distribution of&#13;\nvalues
        associated with input parameters is quantified. The&#13;\nresults are used
        to estimate the uncertainty in dose prediction resulting from a given concentration
        of l 3 1 I 2 in air&#13;\ntransported over the pasture-cow-milk pathway. The
        NRC&#13;\nrecommended generic default values are compared with the&#13;\nstatistical
        distribution of the selected parameters, and&#13;\nthe probability of the
        default values not being exceeded is estimated. The results reported herein
        provide an estimation of actual uncertainties to be expected under&#13;\nreal-world
        conditions in lieu of validation experiments.&#13;\nThe relevance of these
        results to the true uncertainties&#13;\nassociated with the parameters and
        models analyzed in this&#13;\nreport is limited because of the qualifying
        assumptions and the quality of data. However, methods of taking results&#13;\nfrom
        these analyses into account when determining compliance&#13;\nwith regulatory
        statutes are discussed.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-07-16T20:47:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-07-16T20:47:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1979-10</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        mathematical model of the fluid and electrolyte distribution in a standard
        laboratory dog was developed.  It adequately predicted measured changes in
        distribution of various chemical substances following administration of saline
        and alkaline solutions; however, the measured changes due to acid addition
        were not as well predicated.&#13;\nA new fluid compartment was added to the
        standard dog model to simulate hypothyroidism as a result of a hypothesis
        of body chemistry changes in hypothyroid animals.  Although most parameters
        of the new compartment were determined from the literature, some were chosen
        numerically to correlate most accurately the model prediction and the chemical
        data take on hypothyroid dogs following an alkaline chemical infusion.  Both
        hypothyroid and euthyroid dogs received injections of acid solution to provide
        chemical data for  comparing distributional changes in these groups and paring
        chemical distributional changes in these groups and for validation of the
        models simulation these states.  The results proved statistically the hypothyroid
        dogs respond differently from normal ones to acid infusion.  However, the
        hypothyroid model, like the normal mode, did not predict these experimental
        results well.  Laboratory technological problems accounted for many of these
        discrepancies.  The results of this research have suggested that additional
        experiments and other chemical perturbations are necessary to test the biochemical
        hypotheses formulated in this Memorandum.  The ideas explored are applicable
        to studies of other disease states that exhibit gross fluid and electrolyte
        abnormalities.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-07-19T23:40:35Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-07-19T23:40:35Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1969-06</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        volatilization of organic environmental contaminants from water bodies to

        methods for calculating volatilization&#13;\nrates for various compounds from
        rivers, lakes and other water bodies under&#13;\nvarious conditions of temperature

        thermodynamics of systems involving&#13;\nhydrophobic organic solutes and
        water. A result of the thermodynamic analysis is the&#13;\ndevelopment of
        the fugacity approach for calculating multi-phase equilibria applicable&#13;\nto
        environmental partitioning. The approach can also be applied to calculating
        multiresistance&#13;\ntransfer as may occur in lakes. Correlations are developed
        for predicting&#13;\nor checking consistency of data for aqueous solubility,

        many quantitative analytical techniques (such as electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation,
        countercurrent distribution, column or paper chromatography, various distillation
        techniques etc.) a mixture of several species of molecules is analyzed by
        subjecting it to conditions under which the several species migrate at different
        rates.  In situations where chemical reactions may occur among the several
        species and where the extents of the reactions are non-negligible these techniques
        fail in the sense that the usual methods for numerically determining the quantities
        of the various species are not applicable.  In such situations the analytical
        system is ordinarily modified so that no non-negligible reactions occur.  However,
        in some cases a modification of this kind may be either impossible or inconvenient.
        \ This paper will present a mathematical framework which under certain circumstances
        will allow a quantitative analysis, even in the presence of non-negligible
        chemical reactions amongst the species.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-07-22T19:09:12Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-07-22T19:09:12Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1962-06</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        System</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>This study examines the thesis that a
        part of the human physiological system can be simulated by a suitably constructed
        mathematical model.  The model employed derives from a class of mathematical
        programming methods that were originally developed for representing complex
        military and industrial activities and have recently been used to represent
        involved chemical equilibria. &#13;\nThe motivation for this research is the
        long-range view that a successful mathematical simulation of the human system
        or of human subsystems would provide an important tool for biological investigations.
        \ A sufficiently complex mathematical model-that is, a model that embodies
        sufficiently complex mathematical model-that is, a model that embodies sufficient
        chemical and biological detail to represent a whole, functioning human system
        or subsystem-could be used to explore biological hypotheses, environmental
        stress reactions, and interplay of dependent subsystems, and could serve as
        a pedagogical tool or even as an aid to medical diagnosis.  Of course, the
        foregoing long-range view is an ultimate goal.  For the moment, only the techniques,
        concepts, and characteristics of such a mathematical model are being explored.
        \ This paper presents the results of a simulation of the external respiratory
        function.  Respiration, and the consequent gas exchanges at the lung surfaces,
        involves many chemical reactions and a transformation of venous blood into
        arterial blood.  This activity was chosen as a test cast to explore the feasibility
        of constructing a mathematical model of a human subsystem.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-07-22T20:34:23Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-07-22T20:34:23Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1959-09</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        thermodynamic principles relating to steady state processes, a detailed biophysicochemical
        model of the human external respiratory subsystem was constructed. Mathematical
        experiments performed with this model give good agreement with reported physiological
        data relating to the functioning of this subsystem under normal and some abnormal
        conditions. Because of the complexity of the model, experiments with it are
        conducted on a high-speed computer. &#13;\nThe model was applied to the representation
        of the exchanges of respiratory gases and related chemical phenomena occurring
        between the venous and arterial sides of the total air-blood system. In addition,
        the model was used to explore the quantitative as well as qualitative significance
        of biochemical functions that are believed to be important in establishing
        the characteristics of the system. These functions include the Bohr effects
        of hemoglobin and various hypotheses of carbamino formation, as well as the
        dynamic steady-state gradients imposed by the erythrocyte metabolic pump and
        the disparate concentrations of nondiffusible species operating across the
        cell membranes.&#13;\nThe capacity of mathematical models of this type to
        incorporate and rigorously interrelate a large number of detailed biochemical
        reactions so as to yield total subsystem effects that compare well with physiological
        reality suggest that such models should provide a useful tool for many biological
        investigations.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-07-24T19:01:16Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-07-24T19:01:16Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1962-12</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        for the system Cd-Pb, Zn-Fe (II)-CO3- PO4 -H20 in the interstitial waters
        of the upper meter of Lake Erie sediments. To closely approximate anoxic sediment
        conditions, extrusion and squeezing were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere
        shortly after coring. Interstitial water concentrations of ferrous iron, zinc,
        cadmium, lead, and carbonate alkalinity were about a factor of 3-5 greater
        in the near-shore Ashtabula cores than in the central basin. Pore waters were
        supersaturated with respect to vivianite (Fe3 (PO4)2 8H20) and siderite (FeC03)
        which were generally in equilibrium with each other. Cadmium, lead and zinc,
        however, were under saturated with respect to carbonate and phosphate minerals
        phases. Metal concentrations were generally greatest in the 10 cm immediately
        below the sediment-water interface. Calculations showed 90-98 percent of the
        lead, 20-60 percent of the zinc, and 5 percent of the cadmium to be inorganically
        complexed. Organic complexation tied up additional metal and may account for
        the larger total dissolved metal levels in the upper 10 cm of the sediment
        pore waters.&#13;\nThis report was submitted in fulfillment of Contract No.

        is to develop the equations&#13;\nfor modeling of toxic substances in estuaries
        and to demonstrate the application&#13;\nof these equations to present and
        anticipated problem areas. The present structure of the model is two-dimensional
        (longitudinal-vertical)&#13;\ninteracting with lateral embayments which may
        operate in a steady-state or&#13;\ntime-variable mode. The water column is
        segmented into two vertical layers&#13;\nto incorporate the typical estuarine
        circulation interacting with a bed which&#13;\nis also segmented into two
        layers - an active interfacial region and a deeper&#13;\nstationary bed. Adsorption-desorption
        kinetics are included which, in the&#13;\ncase of the Kepone distribution
        of the James River, are assumed to be at&#13;\nequilibrium. Both steady-state,
        as well as time-variable, conditions were&#13;\nanalyzed to calibrate the
        model to reproduce presently observed concentrations&#13;\nof Kepone. Sensitivity
        analyses and projections were conducted to&#13;\nestimate the time required
        to reduce the present level of contamination.&#13;\nIn order to provide the
        necessary background for the development of the&#13;\nmodel, the various factors
        which affect the kinetic interactions of sorption&#13;\nand which affect the
        distributions of the suspended and bed solids are discussed&#13;\nin the introductory
        sections. This is followed by the development of&#13;\na one-dimensional analysis,
        similar to the classical estuarine water quality&#13;\nequations in present
        use. This type of analysis may be used for preliminary&#13;\nassessment of
        a problem. An example of its application to the James River&#13;\nis included.
        A procedure of analysis to address the problem of organic chemicals in estuaries
        has been structured. The procedure involves a series &#13;\nof analytical
        and computational steps, relating to the fluid transport, the solids&#13;\ndistribution
        and the concentrations of the organic chemical in the water and&#13;\nthe
        bed. Each step involves the determination or assignment of the appropriate&#13;\ntransport,
        transfer and/or reaction coefficients to analyze a particular&#13;\nconstituent
        of the system. Equally important, each step provides the&#13;\ninput for the
        computation of the next element, for which an additional coefficient&#13;\nis
        required. The analysis proceeds in a sequence of increasing complexity,&#13;\neach
        element yielding a calibration or validation of an essential&#13;\nconstituent.
        The final output is the temporal or spatial distribution of&#13;\nthe organic
        chemical.&#13;\nSpecific recommendations are presented relating to further
        calibration&#13;\nand validation of these models in other estuaries. Particular
        attention&#13;\nshould be directed to an assessment of the inputs, characterization
        of bed&#13;\nconditions and evaluation of kinetic interactions. It is planned
        to incorporate&#13;\nthese factors in ongoing research.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-07-25T23:41:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-07-25T23:41:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1981-02</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        Distribution In New York Bight</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>O'Connor, Donald J.</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>Mancini,
        John L.</dc:creator>\n<dc:subject>Carbon-Oxygen Distribution</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>New
        York Bight</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>The steady-state analysis presented
        in this report provides a basis for&#13;\nassessment of dissolved oxygen in
        the New York Bight, particularly in the&#13;\napex area. The analysis indicates
        that the discharge of carbonaceous and&#13;\nnitrogenous wastes does not materially
        affect the dissolved oxygen levels&#13;\nthrough bacterial oxidation. Furthermore,
        the discharge of solids (sludge&#13;\ndisposal, dredge spoils and construction
        debrisj do not influence these&#13;\nconcentrations on a bight-wide scale.
        The localized sludge disposal area&#13;\nis evidently affected in this regard,
        but this area is restricted to a&#13;\nrelatively limited extent. On the other
        hand, the depression of dissolved&#13;\noxygen, particularly in the hypolimetic
        waters, is affected by phytoplankton&#13;\nrespiration and decay and the vertical
        transport structure. It is probable&#13;\nthat the discharge of wastewater
        from the treatment plants and urban runoff&#13;\nhas some effect on the growth
        of phytoplankton and the subsequent decay&#13;\ntbrough the inorganic nutrient
        route. The degree to which water quality&#13;\nconditions are affected by
        these inputs may be quantified by the development&#13;\nand validation of
        a model defining these kinetic interactions. The analysis, developed in this
        second phase, will be extended to incorporate the kinetic&#13;\nroutes, relating
        the growth and decay of the phytoplankton to the nutrient&#13;\nconcentrations
        resulting from these wastewater inputs. Thus, the effect; of&#13;\nthe discharges
        will be defined, providing a basis for areawide water quality&#13;\nplanning,
        particularly with respect to the relative influence of the point&#13;\nsources
        from treatment plants and the distributed sources from urban runoff&#13;\nby
        contrast to the effects of other inputs such as the disposal practices&#13;\nand
        atmospheric inputs.&#13;\n&#13;\nThe present analysis is directed to the definition
        of a transport&#13;\nstructure in accordance with the original contract to
        provide the Brookhaven&#13;\ninvestigators with a reasonable transport field
        for summer conditions.&#13;\nThe transport equations included advective and
        dispersive terms in a multi--segmented horizontal system with two vertical
        layers.  The advective terms were developed by a minimum energy principle,
        which yield the general observed flow pattern in the Bight.  The overall transport
        field also included consistent values of the various disperation coefficinents.
        \ It is recognized that advective-dispersive models of this nature do not
        necessarily&#13;\nresult in a unique solution for the transport. However,
        its validity to&#13;\nrepresent average summer conditions is demonstrated
        by its ability to reproduce&#13;\nthe salinity distribution for the two years.
        The analysis further indicates that the dissolved oxygen concentration&#13;\nin
        the hypolimnetic waters is particularly sensitive to the respiration and&#13;\ndecay
        rates of the phytoplankton and the vertical dispersion coefficients.&#13;\nRelatively
        small changes of these paremeters, within the range of measured&#13;\nvalues,
        cases significant changes in the dissolved oxygen levels. Thus, from both
        a transport and kinetic viewpoint, the present analysis&#13;\nreasonably reproduces
        observed water quality conditions and permits assussment&#13;\nof the effect
        of wastewater inputs. In view of the potential significance of&#13;\nthese
        aischarges on dissolved oxygen and other water quality parameters this&#13;\nanalysis
        had indicated the analytic direction on which to proceed and provide&#13;\na
        valid basis for the more definitive time variable analysis.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-07-26</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-07-26</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1979-08</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        the carbonaceous and&#13;\nnitrogenous components and wastewater on the dissolved&#13;\noxygen
        resources of a natural water system. The second&#13;\nmodeling framework concentrates

        the biological and chemical&#13;\ntransformations that can occur. The modeling

        In Anoxic Sedments</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Gonzalez, Adrian M.</dc:creator>\n<dc:subject>Heavy
        Metal Sorption</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Anoxic Sediments</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>The
        U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is currently developing Sediment Quality
        Criteria&#13;\n(SQC) for heavy metal chemical contaminants. The approach used
        in their development is based on&#13;\nEquilibrium Partitioning between sediment
        and porewater phases. The toxicity of these chemicals is&#13;\nrelated to
        the porewater, free-metal chemical potential. Therefore, anything that reduces
        this activity&#13;\nwill reduce the toxicity of the sediment.&#13;\nSediment
        studies have identified a reactive pool of solid phase, acid volatile sulfide
        (AVS)&#13;\nwhich controls porewater metal activity. In all sediment studies,
        no toxicity is observed when the&#13;\nmetal/AVS molar ratio is less than
        one. In theory, when the metal/AVS molar ratio is greater than&#13;\none,
        sediment porewater activity can potentially reach toxic levels. In certain
        copper toxicity studies,&#13;\nhowever, where sediment acid volatile sulfide
        concentrations were extremely low and sediment copper&#13;\nconcentrations
        relatively high, no toxicity was observed. This apparent anomaly does not
        refute the&#13;\nacid volatile sulfide theory. It does, however, suggest the
        presence of one or more additional metalbinding&#13;\nphases which can reduce
        free-metal copper porewater activity.&#13;\nIn this thesis, metal binding
        to freshwater sediments was investigated in the same oxygen-free&#13;\nand
        pH buffered conditions found in subsurface, freshwater sediment environments.
        Achieving these&#13;\nobjectives required the development of a new experimental
        technique called an Anoxic Sequential  Batch Titration (ASBT). The technique
        is a titration method where sediments are spiked with metal&#13;\nions under
        anoxic and pH buffered conditions. Its ability to maintain these conditions
        was proven by&#13;\nexperiment. System anaerobicity, the kinetics of copper
        sorption, the dependence or independence of&#13;\nsorption on solids concentration,
        and pH buffering ability is described in detail. After these system&#13;\nparameters
        are shown to be controllable, the results of sediment/metal sorption studies
        are presented.&#13;\nCorrelation of sediment sorption capacities to total
        sediment organic carbon strongly suggests that this&#13;\nis the sediment
        property responsible for the additional metal binding and reduction in sediment&#13;\ntoxicity.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-07-27</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-07-27</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1992-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        manual for the use of&#13;\nCHEMIST, a computer program used to simulate complex
        chemical&#13;\nequilibria. CHEMIST has been used to make mathematical models&#13;\nof
        simple chemical systems (e.g., bicarbonate system in water&#13;\nsolution),
        organic systems (e.g., the ionization of serum&#13;\nalbumin), viable biological
        systems (e.g., blood chemistry,&#13;\nelectrolyte and fluid distribution in
        the \"whole body,\" function&#13;\nof the kidney), and inorganic systems at
        non-standard&#13;\npressures and temperatures (e.g., planet atmospheres, rocket&#13;\nexhausts,
        graphite-carbon vapor system). Obviously, CHEMIST&#13;\ncan meet the varied
        requirements of many different users, except&#13;\nthat it is applicable only
        to the computation of chemical&#13;\nequilibria or \"steadystates\" and not
        directly to the study&#13;\nof chemical kinetics.&#13;\nThe program--written
        in natural language to facilitate&#13;\nuse by professionals not trained in
        computer programming--&#13;\nhas evolved over the years, and will continue
        to do so. Consequently,&#13;\nthis manual will be modified periodically to
        keep&#13;\nabreast of changes. This edition of the program and manual will
        be designated as CHEMIST; subsequent editions will be&#13;\ndesignated by
        an appropriate Roman numeral (i.e., CHEMIST II ). Chapter I is a general introduction
        to the theory and&#13;\nthe literature. Chapter II details the operational
        control&#13;\nof the program, and Chap. III shows elaborated examples of&#13;\nits
        use. Finally, Chap. IV documents the subroutines.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-07-27</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-07-27</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1967-12</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        Memorandum is one in a continuing series of RAND&#13;\npublications dealing

        with the RAND&#13;\nprogram of research on rocket fuels and propellents and&#13;\nin
        biology and physiology. It details a method by which&#13;\na multi- or single-phase
        chemical equilibrium problem with&#13;\na large number of different chemical
        species can be replaced&#13;\nby one with relatively few species. The purpose

        into problems which are more amenable to&#13;\n&#13;\nnumerical solution.
        This Memorandum is concerned with a technique first&#13;\ndeveloped in an
        earlier Paper, On the Reduction of Certain&#13;\nMultiplicative Chemical Equilibrium
        Systems to Mathematically&#13;\nEquivalent Additive Systems, P-2419, by G.
        B. Dantzig and&#13;\nJ. C. DeHaven. The present Memorandum generalizes the&#13;\ntechnique
        to systems more complex than those to which the&#13;\ntechnique of the earlier
        paper is readily applicable. The&#13;\nbasic approach of the previous paper
        is described briefly, but&#13;\nthe reader should be familiar with P-2419
        for certain&#13;\nexplanatory and illustrative material which has not been&#13;\nincluded

        young, 70-kilogram human male. The&#13;\nmathematical procedure simulates

        reactions&#13;\nand electrochemical relations which seem necessary to&#13;\nestablish
        the fluid and electrolyte distribution. Because&#13;\nthe whole body is being

        validation experiments, consisting of chemical stresses&#13;\napplied to the

        profiles of pore water and sediment solids chemistry were obtained&#13;\nfrom
        two sites in Lake Erie. Samples were collected using both gravity&#13;\ncoring
        and pore water \"peeper\" techniques. In general, concentrations of&#13;\nnutrients
        and toxic metals in sediment solids decreased with increasing depth.&#13;\nComparison
        of pore water \"peeper data to gravity core data showed that&#13;\n\"peeper\"
        data provides higher resolution near the sediment-water interface.&#13;\nModifications
        of the present peeper are required to adequately sample easily&#13;\noxidizable

        Mixing</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Maximum Entrophy</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>A
        review and a critique of the theories of estuarine&#13;\nmixing which have
        been proposed is presented and it is concluded&#13;\nthat the simplifications
        usually employed in the&#13;\nmixing theories based on the convective diffusion
        equation&#13;\nare not applicable to the mixing process in, an estuary.&#13;\nThe
        theory of tidal mixing which has been proposed by Preddy&#13;\nis discussed
        and his approach forms the basis for the theory&#13;\nof maximum entropy mixing
        which is developed. The analysis of the mixing process in an estuary is formulated
        in terms&#13;\nof the theory of Markov chains. Three conservation laws&#13;\nwhich
        any physically reasonable mixing process must satisfy&#13;\nare formulated
        and related to the properties of a Markov&#13;\nchain. The estimate of the
        appropriate mixing matrix is&#13;\nbased on the maximum entropy principle
        of statistical mechanics&#13;\nand information theory. A numerical technique
        is presented for the solution of the resulting simultaneous transcendental&#13;\nequations.
        The equilibrium salinity intrusion data from the Delaware River Model is analyzed
        and compared&#13;\nwith the theoretical predictions based on the maximum entropy&#13;\nestimate
        of the mixing process. The resulting agreement is noted and it is concluded
        that the theory of maximum entropy&#13;\nmixing is a sound theoretical and
        practical solution to the problem of characterizing the mixing process in
        an estuary.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-07-29T18:21:33Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-07-29T18:21:33Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1967-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        parts describing (1) sample collection and&#13;\nanalysis, (2) analyses of
        field samples and mixing experiments, and (3) evaluation of metal&#13;\nrelease
        and development of the methodology for the translator. The first section describes&#13;\nsample
        collection, handling and chemical analyses together with QA/QC data. We used
        clean&#13;\ntechniques from the beginning of sample collection to the completion
        of laboratory analyses.&#13;\nThe second part summarizes total and dissolved
        copper and lead concentrations, pH, dissolved&#13;\norganic carbon, alkalinity
        and solids concentrations of the POTW effluents and Delaware&#13;\nRiver water
        samples. Mixing experiment results are also included in this section. Those&#13;\nmixing
        experiments were conducted at three pH levels (pH 6, ambient pH and pH 8).
        Mixing&#13;\nresults indicate that copper shows conservative behavior at ambient
        solids concentrations.&#13;\nRemoval of copper from the dissolved phase was
        observed at high solids concentration (larger&#13;\nthan 200 mg/L). The removal
        process followed first order reaction kinetics. The last part of&#13;\nthis
        report contains the assessment of metal release from POTW effluent particulates
        and the&#13;\ndevelopment of a chemical translator for the Delaware River.
        The ratio of dissolved to total&#13;\nrecoverable metal concentrations were
        determined after mixing at ratios of 1:l and 1:2 of&#13;\neffluent to receiving
        water. Total suspended solids concentration in a mixture was calculated&#13;\nassuming
        conservative mixing. A linear regression equation was developed to describe
        a&#13;\nrelationship between the ratio of dissolved to total recoverable metal
        and total suspended&#13;\nsolids. Both NY/NJ harbor data for lead, and data
        collected in this study for copper, have&#13;\nbeen tested to validate the
        regression model. The model results for NYNJ harbor data&#13;\nindicate a
        better predictability than a translator developed by the EPA method. The developed&#13;\nchemical
        translator can be used to establish wasteload allocations for discharges to
        the&#13;\nDelaware River Estuary.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-07-30T19:23:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-07-30T19:23:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1996-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        oxygen variations of 1.0 mg/l or greater appear to be possible from a mathematical

        model in natural waters. This model is constructed on the basis of the principle
        of conservation of mass. This is an elementary physical law which is satisfied
        by microscopic natural systems. The use of this principle is dictated primarily
        by the lack of any more specific physical laws which can be applied to these
        biological systems. The use of this principle is dictated primarily by the
        lack of any more specific physical laws which can be applied to these biological
        systems. An alternative conservation law, that of conservation of energy,
        can also be used. However, the details of how mass is transferred from species
        to species is better understood than corresponding energy transformations.
        The mass interactions relate among other factors to the kinetics of the populations

        solution of the conventional diffusion equation has an obvious shortcoming;
        that is, the substance concentration will rise instantaneously everywhere
        when substance is introduced at some point in the sea. Although such instantaneous
        propagation of substance makes a negligibly small contribution to the concentration
        at large distances from the source, it might cause serious error in predicting
        water pollution, micro-organism distributions, etc. A diffusion equation which
        overcomes this difficulty is the telegraph equation characterized by a finite
        propagation velocity. An ad hoc derivation of the telegraph equation from
        a set of hydromechanical equations identifies the parameters involved in the
        equation. Thus, the propagation velocity is related to the correlation tensor
        of turbulent velocity. As a result, the one-particle dispersion law by Taylor
        and the relative diffusion law by Richardson can be deduced from the telegraph

        York Bight</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>This monograph describes the water
        quality of New York Bight as measured by temperature, light, salinity, dissolved
        oxygen, various nitrogen and phosphorus forms, pH, heavy metals, coliform
        bacteria, and phytoplankton chlorophyll. Major water quality monitoring in
        the Bight, initiated in 1948, has been sporadic in the past with gaps from
        3 to 10 years when no major sampling was conducted. These data indicate that
        bottom dissolved oxygen percent saturation levels in the disposal areas of
        the apex have decreased from 67% in 1949 to 30% in 1974. Surface total iron
        concentrations in the apex have increased from 20  u/l in 1949 to about 90
        u/l in 1969, and are higher than background open ocean levels. Coliform bacterial
        influence appears to be confined to an area of 3.2 to 4.8 km (2 to 3 mi) radius
        from the discharge point of a sewage sludge barge dump. Nitrogen is generally
        the more important nutrient relative to phosphorus with respect to limiting
        phytoplankton growth in the Bight. Man\u2019s impact on the water quality
        of the region appears to be significant with more than 50% of the total input
        of iron, copper, cadmium, chromium, suspended solids, and total phosphorus
        attributed to barge discharges alone. An overall analysis of New York Bight
        to quantitatively assess the relative impact of the major discharges is recommended.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-08-01T20:42:25Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-08-01T20:42:25Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1977-10</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        successful calibration/verification of a numerical hydrodynamic model applied
        to an estuarine/coastal area requires sets of self-consistent data. These&#13;\ndata
        sets must contain freshwater inflows on tributaries; tides at ocean entrances&#13;\nas
        well as at various interior stations; meteorological data at one or more stations,&#13;\nfrom
        which the surface wind stress and heat flux can be determined; and currents,&#13;\ntemperature,
        and salinity at several locations throughout the modeled area In addition,
        the bathymetry must also be represented on the numerical grid. This report
        presents data sets employed in the development of a three-dimensional hydrodynamic
        model of Chesapeake Bay. Since the Bay is so large, there is a lack of synoptic
        data throughout the Bay and its tributaries.  Three relatively extensive synoptic
        field data sets were identified for use in this study.  These data sets were
        collected during June-July 1980, April 1983, and September 1983. In&#13;\naddition,
        for the preliminary calibration of the hydrodynamic model, data from the&#13;\nphysical
        model of Chesapeake Bay located on Kent Island, Maryland, were identified.&#13;\nData
        from each set are presented in a combination of graphical and tabular forms.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-08-01T20:01:01Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-08-01T20:01:01Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1991-01</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        research was undertaken to develop and apply a mathematical model&#13;\nof
        the water quality in large lakes, particularly Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay&#13;\n(Part
        1) and Lake Erie (Part 2). A mathematical model was developed for analysis
        of the interactions between&#13;\nnutrient discharges to Lake Erie, the response
        of phytoplankton to&#13;\nthese discharges, and the dissolved oxygen depletion
        that occurs as a consequence.&#13;\nDissolved oxygen, phytoplankton chlorophyll
        for diatoms and nondiatoms,&#13;\nzooplankton biomass, nutrient concentrations
        in available and unavailable&#13;\nforms and inorganic carbon are considered
        in the model. Extensive&#13;\nwater quality data for Lake Erie was analyzed
        and statistically reduced.&#13;\nComparison of data from 1970 and 1973-74
        to model calculations served for&#13;\ncalibration of the model. A verification
        computation was also performed for 1975, a year when no anoxia was observed.
        Recent developments in phytoplankton growth and uptake kinetics are&#13;\nincluded
        in this analysis. The methods of sedimentary geochemistry are&#13;\nexpanded
        to include an analysis of sediment oxygen demand within the framework&#13;\nof
        mass balances. Projected effects of varying degrees of phosphorus&#13;\nremoval
        on dissolved oxygen, anoxic area, chlorophyll, transparency and&#13;\nphosphorus
        concentration are presented. This report was submitted in fulfillment of Grant

        wet oxidation and heat treatment - on the benthal oxygen demands and leaching
        rates of&#13;\nsludge deposits. Two types of laboratory studies were conducted:
        ( 1 ) Warburg studies to determine the oxygen demand of the sludges when in
        an aerobic condition and (2) continuous flow reactor studies with the sludge
        layered on the bottom of reactors to simulate actual sludge deposits.&#13;\nThe
        results of the studies indicated that treatment of the sludge prior to disposal
        at sea would significantly reduce the benthal oxygen demands and leaching
        rates of the bottom deposits. An oxygen diffusion analysis indicated that
        anaerobic decomposition in the raw,&#13;\ndigested, heat-treated and low wet
        oxidized sludge layers markedly increased the benthal oxygen demands. In contrast
        the bottom layers&#13;\nof the intermediate and h i g h wet oxidized sludges

        a simplified methodology for applying&#13;\nmathematical models to the analysis
        of water quality.&#13;\nSince the methodology developed in this Guide has
        not been widely&#13;\ntested, we are providing a limited number of copies
        for in-house&#13;\nuse. We would like your evaluation as to the usefulness
        and&#13;\nreliability of the procedures. If we find that this Guide would&#13;\nbe
        helpful to local and State personnel, additional copies will&#13;\nbe printed.
        Please maintain control of your copies until our evaluation is completed.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-08-02T23:32:11Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-08-02T23:32:11Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1971-03</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        modeling program and a model verification&#13;\nanalysis program have been
        developed that have application to a wide variety&#13;\nof water resource
        management problems. The Water Quality Analysis Simulation&#13;\nProgram,
        WASP, is based on the flexible compartment approach. It may&#13;\nbe applied
        to water bodies in a one, two, or three-dimensional configuration,&#13;\nand
        kinetic models may be structured to include linear and non-linear&#13;\nreactions.
        The user may choose, via input options, to employ constant or&#13;\ntime-variable
        transport and kinetic processes, as well as point and nonpoint&#13;\nwaste
        discharges. The Model Verification Program, MVP, may be used&#13;\nas an indicator
        of \"goodness of fit\" or adequacy of the model as a representation&#13;\nof
        the real world.&#13;\nTo date, WASP has been applied to over twenty water
        resource management&#13;\nproblems. These applications have included one,
        two and three-dimensional&#13;\nconfigurations and a number of different physical,
        chemical and biological&#13;\nmodeling frameworks, such as BOD-DO, eutrophication,
        and toxic substances.&#13;\nA user's manual and program listings have been
        prepared. The user's manual was oriented towards the system analyst, whose
        responsiblity it would be to design, develop and debug new kinetic models
        for end users, as well as the end user who must prepare the data input to
        the program.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-08-03</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-08-03</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1983-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        paper introduces two techniques for approximating the Biot-Savart integral
        for deforming elliptical Gaussian functions. The primary motivation is to
        develop a high spatial accuracy vortex method. The first technique is a regular
        perturbation of the streamfunction in the small parameter \u03B5  = (a-1)/(a+1)where
        a^2&#13;\nis the aspect ratio of the basis function. This perturbative technique
        is suitable for direct interactions. In the far field, the paper studies the
        applicability of the fast multipole method for deforming elliptical Gaussians
        since the multipole series are divergent. The noncompact basis functions introduce
        a new computational length scale that limits the efficiency of the multipole&#13;\nalgorithm
        but by imposing a lower bound on the finest mesh size, one can approximate
        the far-field stream function to any specified tolerance.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-08-10T17:41:07Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-08-10T17:41:07Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        literature review and a series of laboratory experiments were conducted&#13;\nto
        investigate the mechanisms that regulate the intensity of oxidation-reduction&#13;\nin
        natural environments. Results of the literature review indicated&#13;\nthat
        following depletion of oxygen and nitrate, the highly reduced conditions&#13;\nreached
        by systems containing substantial amounts of organic matter appear to&#13;\ninvolve
        mixed potentials generated by unknown organic oxidation-reduction&#13;\ncouples
        that act in concert with inorganic oxidation-reduction couples. Results of
        the laboratory studies confirmed that organic oxidation-reduction couples&#13;\nof
        an unknown nature were exerting a strong influence on Eh. The iron and manganese
        oxidation-reduction systems were also shown to be affecting Eh,&#13;\nalthough
        in a manner consistent with the existence of a mixed potential.&#13;\nRedox
        potential should only be used as a semiquantitative indicator of the intensity
        of reduction. Precise evaluation of the reduction status of anaerobic natural
        envirsnmeilts should be determined by rigorous analysis&#13;\nof various chemical
        constituents, including manganese (IT) ,, iron (II), and sulfide. Comparism
        of results of the present study with those others indicated that microbial
        succession and appearance of reduced&#13;\nproducts closely parallel those
        found in flooded soils and sediments. The appearance of reduced products corresponded
        to the sequence roughly&#13;\npredicted by thermodynamics.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-08-22T20:55:22Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-08-22T20:55:22Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1978-08</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        lake stations representing the three major basins and the Inshore Zone of
        Lake Ontario. Cores were sectioned for characterization of the surface sediments
        according to inorganic P chemical mobility. Physical mobility was characterized
        by measurement of P release from intact cores incubated under controlled laboratory
        conditions. The proportions of potentially chemically mobile inorganic P were
        usually high (30 to 60%) in the central basin sediments and low (2 to 8%)
        for the inshore zone sediments. Although the amounts of inorganic P desorbed
        after three successive equilibrations (in .lM NaC1) of Lake Ontario sediments
        represented only 3 to 17% of the potentially mobile inorganic P, sufficient
        inorganic P was desorbed to restore a large part of the original interstitial
        inorganic P concentrations. Interstitial inorganic P (mobile P) concentrations
        ranged from 14 to 1280 Ng/l and were higher than dissolved inorganic P concentrations
        in the overlying water. Diffusion rates estimated from the range of observed
        interstitial inorganic P values ranged from about 0.05 to 0.6 mg m-\u2018
        day-\u2019 and were in agreement with the range of 0.03 to 0.8 mg m-2 day-\u2019
        estimated from P release from intact cores incubated under controlled laboratory
        conditions. Based on an inorganic P flux of 0.2 mg estimated annual contribution
        of inorganic P to Lake Ontario water is equal to about 10% of the external
        P loading.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-09-01T22:31:37Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-09-01T22:31:37Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1975-02</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        models have been used increasingly as decision-making aids in the design of
        lake restoration activities because they provide an approximation of the link
        between nutrients influx and lake trophic status. To evaluate the applicability
        of these models as design tools, a study was conducted in which \"before\"
        and \"after\" data were obtained for twenty-five lakes which experienced reductions
        in nutrient inflow, and comparisons were made of measured and predicted changes
        in lake conditions. Four input/output models were used as predictive tools
        to describe lake response: those reported by Dillon and Wigler (1974) and
        Vollenweider (1975, 1976) and a model developed in this study in which cellular
        biomass, rather than total phosphorus, is used as the trophic state indicator.
        Comparisons of measured and predicted responses were based on general descriptions
        of trophic status; Secchi depth, including the Trophic State Index (TSI) reported
        by Carlson (1977); and a Lake Condition Index(LCI) reported by Uttormark and&#13;\nWall

        are known to be a large sink of nutrient materials and they are trapped in
        estuaries due to the circulation patterns, it was important that the model
        incorporate sediment-water column interactions. The work detailed in this

        from the water column to the bottom sediments. During 1988, measurements were

        research aimed to determine the distribution of selected metals in suspended
        material and fluid mud, to identify potential zones of toxic accumulation,
        and to trace their transport routes.&#13;\nObservations of flow,salinity,
        suspended maierial, pH, and dissolved oxygen were accomplished in Bay-wide
        longitudinal&#13;\nsections and at four anchor stations in the ncrthern Bay
        between March 1979 apd April 1980 The observations cover a range of conditions,
        including seasonal high-low river discharge. sediment influx, neap spring
        tide range, and oxygenated-anoxic water. Samples of suspended material, fluid
        mud, and bed sediment were analyzed for their particle size, organic matter,
        and metal content.&#13;\nMetal concentrations of As, Cu. Mn, Ni, Pb Sn, and
        Zr, in fluid mud and bed sediment per gram of material decrease seaward from
        a maximum in the Baltimore-Susquehanna Rtver Area. The metals Mn, Pb, and
        Zn are four to six times greater&#13;\nthan Fe-corrected average shale, indicating
        major human input and significant accumulation in this zone.&#13;\nMetal concentrations
        rf Cd, Cu, Pb. Ni, and Zn are maximal in surface suspended material from the
        Central Bay. They are higher than landward near potential sources and they
        exceed concentrations in bed sediment 2 to 80 times The enrichment is not
        natural compared to average shale or plankton, it is most likely created by
        bio-accumulation.&#13;\nTransport of particle-associated metals from major
        sources follows either hydrodynamic pathways leading to particle accumulations
        by the estuarine circulation, or bio-ecological routes leading to bio-accumulation.
        Management and monitoring strategies are provided to reduce potentially toxic
        metals to acceptable levels and warn management agencies of toxic hazards.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-09-03T15:28:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-09-03T15:28:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1982-10</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        studies in rivers and streams. Two approaches to waste load allocation are
        addressed: the chemical-specific approach and the whole effluent approach.
        Numerical or analytical toxicant fate models are used to implement the chemical-specific
        approach. Modeling requirements and sampling guidelines are delineated for
        this method. For the whole effluent approach, the method is first summarized

        to added nutrients were determined for individual species within the phytoplankton
        assemblages which were naturally occuring and which were produced by complex

        photochemical reactions&#13;\npostulated as key transformations in the environmental
        mercury cycle&#13;\nwere investigated. Decomposition of dimethylmercury (DMM)
        and&#13;\ndiphenylmercury (DPM) by acids and mercuric salts was shown to be&#13;\npH
        dependent and too slow to be significant under most environmental&#13;\nconditions.
        Degradation of organomercuric salts by acid is even&#13;\nslower. Theoretical
        evidence indicates that loss of elemental&#13;\nmercury or DMM at the air-water
        interface can be important in turbulent&#13;\nsystems.&#13;\nDimethylmercury,
        methylmercuric chloride, methylmercuric hydroxide,&#13;\nand methylmercuric
        ion were not decomposed by sunlight, but phenylmercury&#13;\nand sulfur-bonded
        methylmercuric species were readily&#13;\ndecomposed to inorganic mercury.
        Detailed equilibrium calculations&#13;\nindicate that the sulfur-bonded methylmercuric
        species are the&#13;\npredominant species in natural waters. Quantum yields
        for these&#13;\nreactions are presented along with a technique for calculating&#13;\nsunlight
        photolysis rates from laboratory data.&#13;\nThe report also includes a review

        criteria documents&#13;\nunder section 304(a) of the Clean Water Act) which
        EPA will recommend that States use to&#13;\nadopt nutrient criteria to support

        suitable sampler for taking undisturbed sediment samples was developed.&#13;\nTechniques
        were worked out for measuring (a) oxygen uptake by intact&#13;\nsediment cores,
        (b) dehydrogenase activity of sediment bacteria, and (c)&#13;\ntheir actual
        metabolic heat release. Dehydrogenase activity as a relative&#13;\nmeasure
        of anaerobic metabolism was calibrated by direct calorimetry for&#13;\nuse
        in determining natural rates of sediment metabolism. The concentration&#13;\nof
        reduced end products of anaerobic metabolism was determined by&#13;\nan iodometric
        and dichromate method. Laboratory experiments were&#13;\nconducted to determine
        the equivalents between rates of oxygen consumption&#13;\non the one hand
        and loss of organic carbon of sediments and liberation of&#13;\nnutrient salts,
        e.g. nitrates, phosphates, silicates, and ammonia, on the&#13;\nother. Seasonal
        measurements of oxygen consumption at 33 stations in&#13;\nPuget Sound provided
        benchmark information for an area that may be subject&#13;\nto worsening conditions
        due to the impact of increasing human population.&#13;\nIn situ oxygen uptake
        by the sediment can be estimated by shipboard&#13;\nmeasurements with sufficient
        accuracy. The original working hypothesis,&#13;\nhowever, that total oxygen
        uptake represents a measure of total metabolism,&#13;\naerobic plus anaerobic,
        in the sediment column appears erroneous, at&#13;\nleast in  organically rich
        sediment. The rate of total oxygen uptake by&#13;\nintact cores represents
        aerobic plus part of the anaerobic metabolism in&#13;\na surface layer of
        indeterminate thickness. At present the only practical&#13;\nway to estimate
        total aerobic and total anaerobic metabolism in sediments&#13;\nis to combine
        the rates of respiratory oxygen uptake by undisturbed&#13;\nsediment cores
        with estimates of anaerobic metabolism derived from dehydrogenase assay of
        subsurface sediment layers. The rate of oxygen uptake by the sediment, however
        remains a useful&#13;\nindex of equilibrium conditions among the various factors
        that affect this&#13;\nrate: oxygen tension, temperature salinity turbulence,
        available&#13;\nmetabolizable energy, size and composition of the community,
        compactness&#13;\nand porosity of sediments and perhaps more. As sedimentation
        rate of&#13;\noxidizable organic matter increases, e.g. in cases of organic
        population&#13;\nand eutrophication, anaerobic metabolism becomes a relatively
        more&#13;\nimportant process in the mineralization of organic matter in sediments.
        In this situation, the estimation of anaerobic metabolism by the&#13;\ndehydrogenase
        assay technique is particularly desirable.&#13;\nThis report was submitted

        cycling of toxic organics in the Great Lakes. A hierarchy of models has been
        developed including 1) a lakescale&#13;\nequilibrium model, 2) a one-dimensional
        steady-state model, 3) one and two-dimensional time dependent models, and
        4) several individual&#13;\nprocess models. These modeling efforts have identified
        process research needs, some of which have been supported. Reported here are
        results of our work on: 1) air-water exchange; 2) photolysis;&#13;\n3) sorption
        and partitioning; 4) particle settling and transport; 5) early diagenetic
        processes in lake sediments; 6) interaction of&#13;\nsediments, contaminants,

        humic substances (humic and fulvic acids) occur in surface waters and groundwaters
        in concentrations ranging from less than 1 mg(C)/L to more than 100 rng(C)/L.
        Humic substances are strong complexing agents for many trace metals in the
        environment and are also capable of forming stable soluble complexes or chelates&#13;\nwith
        radionuclides. Concentrations of humic materials as low as 1 mg(C)/L can produce
        a detectable increase in the mobility of&#13;\nsome actinide elements by forming
        soluble complexes that inhibit sorption of the radionuclides onto rock materials.
        The stability&#13;\nof trace metal- or radionuclide-organic complexes is commonly
        measured by an empirically determined conditional stability constant (K'),
        which is based on the ratio of complexed metal (radionuclide)in solution to
        the product concentration of uncomplexed metal and&#13;\nhumic complexant.
        Larger values of stability constants indicate greater complex stability.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-09-10T13:26:00Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-09-10T13:26:00Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1985-07</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOM) annually collects and chemically
        analyzes sediment samples from sites located in&#13;\ncoastal marine and estuarine
        environments throughout the United States as a part of the National Status
        and Trends (NS&amp;T) Program. While the chemical data provide indications
        of the relative degrees of contamination among the sampling sites, they provide
        neither a measure of adverse biological effects nor an estimate of the potential
        for effects. Data derived&#13;\nfrom a wide variety of methods and approaches
        were assembled and evaluated to identify informal guidelines for use in evaluation
        of the NS&amp;T&#13;\nProgram sediment data. The data from three basic approaches
        to the establishment of effects-based criteria were evaluated: the equilibrium-partitioning
        approach, the spiked-sediment bioassay approach, and various methods of evaluating
        synoptically collected biological and chemical data in field surveys. The
        chemical concentrations observed or predicted by the&#13;\ndifferent methods
        to be associated with biological effects were sorted, and the lower 10 percentile
        and median concentrations were identified along with an overall apparent effects
        threshold. The lower 10 percentile in the data&#13;\nwas identified as an
        Effects Range-Low (ER-L) and the median was identified as an Effects Range-Median
        (ER-MI. Note that these ER-L and&#13;\nER-M values are not to be construed
        as NOAA standards or criteria. The ambient NS&amp;T Program sediment data
        from sampling sites were compared&#13;\nwith the respective ER-L and ER-M
        values for each analyte. The comparisons were used to rank sites with regard
        to the potential for adverse biological effects, assuming that the sites in
        which the average chemical&#13;\nconcentrations exceeded the most ER-L and
        ER-M values would have the highest potential for effects. The rankings indicated
        that a sampling site located in the Hudson-Raritan estuary had the highest
        potential for effects, followed by a site located in Boston Harbor, a site
        located in western Long Island Sound, and a site located in the Oakland estuary
        of San Francisco&#13;\nBay.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-09-08T23:31:08Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-09-08T23:31:08Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1990-03</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        As shown below, the chemistry of iron and manganese are sufficiently similar
        so that a common model formulation can be used. The model is an extension
        of the nutrient&#13;\nand oxygen sediment flux model developed previously
        for application to Chesapeake&#13;\nBay. It has subsequently been applied

        basis used in this report for the development of stochastic model constructs
        from the simulation of zooplankton and benthos dynamics in reservoirs. Parameters
        reviewed and modeled were selected from the mass balance equation: db/dt =
        b [G (A/G)-R -NPM - PM] where b= biomass (mg carbon), t= time (days), G= consumption
        of grazing rate (mg carbon*mg carbon^-1*day^-1), R = respiration (mg carbon*mg
        carbon^-1*day^-1).&#13;\n&#13;\nMathematical constructs, where appropriate
        or justified by the available literature, were developed to describe the effects
        of enviromental components (for example, food, temperature, and oxygen concentration)
        on rate terms in Equation 1. Frequency distributions of rate coefficients
        were formed for as many taxonomic or functional categories of aquatic invertebrates
        as possible. By using carbon units and providing frequency histograms of carbon-nitrogen
        and carbon-phosphorus ratios, the model can trace the cycling of nitrogen
        and phosphorus through zooplankton and benthos compartments. An evaluation
        is presented of strengths and weaknesses in the literature on zooplankton
        and benthos consumption, assimiliation, respiration, and nonpredatory mortality.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-09-10T16:21:10Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-09-10T16:21:10Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1980-03</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        techniques, capably applied, are essential for the sound development and management
        of water resources.  The population of our country is increasing rapidly but
        water use outpaces the growth in population and thus creates demands for water
        \ that frequently impinge on the available supply.  The mounting demands,
        the increasing areas of conflict, and the rising rate of flood damage impel
        a need for refined methods of analysis of water problems.  Consider the planning
        for a water supply for a town or an irrigation project: How much water is
        available in the river?  How does this supply compare with the demand?  Is
        reservoir storage needed?  If so, how much?  Riverflow varies and therefore
        reservoirs are built to store water to tide over from times of excess to times
        of deficiency.  The problem is to design the storage reservoir so that the
        demands for water can be supplied despite variations in riverflow.  Reservoirs
        that are built too small cannot do the job expected of them.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-09-11T23:17:34Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-09-11T23:17:34Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1960</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        gaging-station record is a sample of the rate of flow of a stream at a given
        site.  This sample can be used to estimate the magnitude and distribution
        of future flows if the record is long enough to be representative of the long-term
        flow of the stream.  The reliability of a short-term record for estimating
        future flow characteristics can be improved through correlation with a long-term
        record.  Correlation can be either numerical or graphical, but graphical correlation
        of gaging-station records has several advantages.  The graphical correlation
        methods is described in a step-by-step procedure with an illustrative problem
        of simple correlation, illustrative problems of three examples of multiple
        correlation-removing  seasonal effect-and two examples of correlation of one
        record with two other records.  Except in the problem on removal of seasonal
        effect, the same group of stations is used in the illustrative problems.  The
        purpose of the problems is to illustrate the method-not to show the improvement
        that can result from multiple correlation as compared with simple correlation.
        \ Hydrologic factors determine whether a usable relation exists between gaging-station
        records.  Statistics is only a tool for evaluating and using an existing relation
        ,and the investigator must be guided by knowledge of hydrology.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-09-11T23:53:28Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-09-11T23:53:28Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1960</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        without regard  to the sequence of occurrence.  If the period upon which the
        curve is based represents the long-term flow of a stream, the curve may  be
        used to predict the distribution of future flows for waterpower, water-supply,
        and pollution studies.  This report shows that difference in geology affect
        the low-flow ends of flow-duration curves of streams in adjacent basins.  Thus,
        duration curves are useful in appraising the geologic characteristics of drainage
        basins.  A method for adjusting flow-duration curves of short periods to represent
        long-term conditions is presented.  The adjustment is made by correlating
        the records of a short-term station with those of a long-term station.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-09-12</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-09-12</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1960</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        Surface-Water Techniques</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Double Mass Curves</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>The
        double- mass curve is used to check the consistency of many kinds of hydrologic
        data by comparing date for a single station with that of a pattern composed
        of the data from several other stations in the area.  The double-mass curve
        can be used to adjust inconsistent precipitation data.  The graph of the cumulative
        data of one variable versus the cumulative data of a related variable is a
        straight line so long as the relation between the variables is a fixed ratio.
        \ Breaks in the double-mass curve of such variables are caused by changes
        in the relation between the variables.  These changes may be due to changes
        in the method of data collection or to physical changes that affect the relation.&#13;\nApplications
        of the double-mass curve to precipitation, streamflow, and sediment data,
        and to precipitation-runoff relations are described .  A statistical test
        for significance of an apparent break in the slope of the double-mass curve
        is described by an example.  Poor correlation between the variables can prevent
        detection of inconsistencies in a record, but an increase in the length of
        record tends to offset the effect of poor correlation.  The residual-mass,
        \ curve which is a modification of the double-mass curve, magnifies imperceptible
        breaks in the double-mass curve for detailed study.  Of the several methods
        of fitting a smooth curve to cyclic or periodic data, the moving-are method
        and the double-integration method deserve greater, use in hydrology.  Both
        methods are described in the manual.  The moving-arc method has general applicability,
        and the double integration methods is useful in fitting a curve to cycles
        of sinusoidal form.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-09-13T21:46:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-09-13T21:46:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1960</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        policy forum, the fourth in a series that examines statewide water policy
        issues, was designed&#13;\nto explore past, present, and future issues in
        the watershed that is the largest source of drinking&#13;\nwater supply in
        the state of Delaware \u2013 the Christina Basin. Over 200 attendees heard
        the speakers&#13;\ndiscuss a list of firsts attributable to the Christina
        Basin. The Christina Basin is the home of the first&#13;\npermanent European
        settlement in 1638 at the mouth of the Christinakill, now the present day&#13;\nlocation
        of the City of Wilmington. The only Revolutionary War battle in Delaware was
        fought at&#13;\nCooch\u2019s Bridge along the banks of the Christina River
        near Newark. The basin is an interstate&#13;\nwatershed, the only one in Delaware,
        where the streams flow through three states. It is the home of&#13;\nthe only
        six trout streams in Delaware as well as home to Wyeth and Winterthur and
        DuPont. The&#13;\nBrandywine Valley Association (BVA), formed in the late
        1940s, was the first small watershed&#13;\nassociation in the United States.
        Accordingly, the Christina Basin holds a very special status for our&#13;\nsmall

        essay uses information from Latino immigrants who were victims in the World
        Trade Center (WTC) to illustrate the operation of counting as a central, theoretical
        issue. It examines the present day emphases on the operation of organizations,
        their lack of coordination, and fraud, which are used to explain the lack
        of validity of disaster mortality statistics. It complements these explanations
        with Alfred Schutz's phenomenological perspective, examining the social categories
        and understandings that were used to create the official list of the dead
        by the City of New York, the link of the official list with receipt of money
        from charities, and the work of Asociaci\xF3n Tepeyac de New York in developing
        an unofficial list of Latino victims some of whom were excluded from the official
        list. Results show that the Mexican mass media exaggerated the numbers of
        Mexican dead by a ratio of 15 to 1. Contrary to mass media reports, the Asociaci\xF3n
        also assisted people who were included in the official count of the dead.
        The list of the Asociaci\xF3n is overwhelmingly a list of male names, but
        neither gender has a greater proportion of exclusion from the official list.
        Exclusion from the official list occurs more often to Mexican men recently
        arrived in the country and earning a living in the underground economy of
        Lower Manhattan. A significantly greater proportion of Mexican victims are
        excluded from the official list if compared to Dominicans and Puerto Ricans.
        The social invisibility of some of the Latino victims is not caused solely
        by structural factors such as the operation of bureaucracies and systemic
        discrimination, nor is solely the effect of the categories used to organize
        the count of the dead; it is also a function of the social behavior of Latino
        immigrants and of their surviving kin during the course of their immigration
        and incorporation into the United States. The paper concludes with some suggestions
        about how statistics on disaster deaths can be improved.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-10-18T16:43:37Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-10-18T16:43:37Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1610</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        I need to provide a set of assumptions.  I am treating terrorism as producing
        what is conventionally called disaster.  Understanding disaster, however,
        is seldom  enhanced by focusing on the peculiarities of particular disaster
        agents, in this case, terrorism.  I will look at previous research on diverse
        disaster agents on the basis of a rather universal social unit \u2013 the
        community.  The community is the locus of the response to disaster and such
        social units have the social capital necessary to respond to disasters.  I
        will argue that communities already exhibit considerable resilience in dealing
        with a variety of types of disaster and that we can learn how those capabilities
        might be enhanced.  On the other hand, the implementation of certain types
        of policy relating to terrorism can have the effect of undercutting and dampening
        resilience.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-11-01T20:23:54Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-11-01T20:23:54Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1621</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        as Community Adaptation:The Human Ecology of Emergency Management</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Donner,
        William R.</dc:creator>\n<dc:subject>Emergency Management</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>This
        paper explores how emergency managers make judgments regarding longterm policy
        and offers a sociological account of organizational decision making within
        an ecological context. Discussions with emergency managers focusing on the
        relative merits of rainfall estimation and tornado detection served as data
        to address these issues. Among the thirty-nine (n=39) interviewees, a consensus
        emerged favoring tornado detection over rainfall estimation. From these findings,
        the paper attempts to a) understand why emergency managers prefer tornado
        detection over rainfall estimation and b) develop theoretical generalizations
        explaining trends in these preferences. Concerning the first goal, analysis
        revealed emergency managers stressed the relative threats of common hazards
        in Oklahoma, the capabilities of technology in hazard mitigation, and public
        opinion. Given the environmental, technological, and social concerns reflected
        in this reasoning, there appears to be a strong ecological context driving
        the need for tornado detection among emergency managers. Implications and
        concerns are presented in the final section.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-11-07T18:22:47Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-11-07T18:22:47Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1625</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        emergency planning had its roots in military analogies which viewed emergencies
        as extensions of \"enemy attack\" scenarios. Such thinking was embedded in
        early structural arrangements and was generalized as the appropriate normative
        model for all emergencies. This model viewed emergencies as conditions of
        social chaos which could be rectified by command and control. It is argued
        here that such a view is inadequate based on a knowledge of behavior in emergencies
        and the model is dysfunctional for planning. A more adequate model is presented,
        based on conditions of continuity, coordination and cooperation. This problem
        solving model, based on research rather than military analogies, provides
        a more adequate set of assumptions as the basis for planning. However, legislative
        and technological \"improvements\" often make emergency planning more rigid
        and increasingly inadequate.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-11-08T19:50:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-11-08T19:50:27Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1994</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Article</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1626</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Article;275</dc:relation>\n<dc:publisher>International

        report describes the results of interviews and focus groups,&#13;\ngauging
        support for innovative farmland preservation techniques.&#13;\nFour techniques
        were selected for assessment from approximately&#13;\n30 novel techniques
        identified in previous research: (1) Term&#13;\nconservation easements; (2)
        Land preservation tontines; (3) Rights&#13;\nof first refusal; and (4) Agricultural
        conservation pension with&#13;\npurchase of agricultural conservation easements.
        Data were&#13;\ncollected from three types of stakeholder groups, including
        land&#13;\npreservation program administrators in Delaware and Maryland,&#13;\nDelaware
        legislators, and Delaware landowners.&#13;\nThe results show that these stakeholders
        believed rights of first&#13;\nrefusal was the most promising concept, and
        the groups identified&#13;\nsome specific challenges to effective implementation.
        Targeting&#13;\nareas to implement the technique and having a dedicated, regular&#13;\nfunding
        source were perceived to be essential. Agricultural&#13;\nconservation pensions
        were also viewed favorably, although some&#13;\nwere skeptical that it could
        be implemented in practice. Tontines&#13;\nwere perceived to be an interesting
        concept, but confusing,&#13;\ndifficult to implement, and needing more work
        to flesh out details.&#13;\nTerm easements were, for the most part, not viewed
        favorably.&#13;\nMost saw term easements having the fatal shortcoming of&#13;\nimpermanent
        preservation.&#13;\nA fiscal analysis was preformed to demonstrate how additional&#13;\nfunding
        for innovative techniques might complement continued&#13;\npurchase of agricultural
        conservation easements (PACE) activities.&#13;\nThe results show that the
        conservation pension might preserve&#13;\nmore acres than PACE, while rights
        of first refusal will preserve&#13;\nless, but more threatened, acres. Term
        easements should preserve&#13;\nmany more acres than PACE, albeit temporarily.
        The land&#13;\npreservation tontine will likely act to increase the value
        of land&#13;\nmaintained in agricultural land use, but will not preserve land
        in&#13;\nthe same manner as the other three techniques. Hence, land&#13;\npreservation
        tontines might best be viewed as a complement to the&#13;\nother preservation
        techniques.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-11-18T16:59:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-11-18T16:59:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-10</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Article</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/1891</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>FREC

        States on September 11, 2001 (9/11)resulted in the costliest and deadliest
        disaster in the nation's history.  These attacks manifested the nation's vulnerability
        to these types of disasters and demonstrated that the country was not prepared
        to confront an event of this magnitude and complexity.  However, social science
        research has shown that the organizational resilience of emergency maangement
        organizations enhanced their capacity to respond to this devastating event
        (Kendra and Wachtendorf, 2003a).  This terrorist attack reinforced what the
        social science disaster literature has shown for other types of disasters
        and emergencies: that planning, coordination, and communication are critical
        elements in preparing, responding, and recovering from a disaster.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2005-12-21T18:05:10Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005-12-21T18:05:10Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2005</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/2256</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Miscellaneous

        from the Delaware Department&#13;\nof Transportation, this report gives a
        general picture of the national homeland security framework&#13;\nand the
        way in which infrastructure security organization and policies have evolved
        within that&#13;\nframework.&#13;\n&#13;\nThe report studies the national
        overview of infrastructure security, including the history of&#13;\nfederal
        involvement and influence, and evaluates the risks, threats, and vulnerabilities
        for three&#13;\ncritical infrastructure sectors. In addition, it offers specific
        analysis on some of the specific risks,&#13;\nthreats, and vulnerabilities
        for Delaware. It outlines the organization of infrastructure security&#13;\nwith
        an assessment of the current structure\u2019s effectiveness. Lastly, the report
        provides&#13;\nrecommendations for change to improve the organization of infrastructure

        report provides a brief history of mentoring in Delaware and the process that&#13;\nculminated
        in the passage of the Professional Development and Educator Accountability&#13;\nAct
        (SB 260) in 2000. It then describes in detail the Delaware New Teacher Mentoring/&#13;\nInduction
        Program, which is a mandatory, three-year induction program for all new&#13;\npublic
        school teachers and other school professionals, such as nurses and counselors.&#13;\nSurveys
        that were administered in spring 2005 to the program\u2019s new teachers,
        mentors,&#13;\nand lead mentors are the source of much of the evaluation\u2019s
        data. Although the response&#13;\nrate was low, the evaluation indicates a
        high degree of satisfaction with the program and&#13;\ncompliance with its
        requirements. It also indicates that only ten percent of new teacher&#13;\nrespondents
        left public school teaching the next school year, a significant drop in the&#13;\noverall
        attrition rate for first-year teachers. Finally, the report provides recommendations&#13;\nfor
        improving the mentoring/induction program. The evaluation will continue this
        year&#13;\nwith a case study analysis of four districts and two charter schools.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-03-03T16:33:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-03-03T16:33:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-03-03T16:33:48Z</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/2315</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>IPA;285</dc:relation>\n</oai_dc:dc>\n</metadata>\n

        on January 24, 2003.&#13;\nChanges in the Clayton area continue and prompt
        this amendment of Clayton\u2019s comprehensive plan. This&#13;\nplan amendment
        consolidates the provisions of the 2002 Update, the July 2003 amendment, and
        the April&#13;\n2004 amendment into a single document. It provides current
        information on population, transportation,&#13;\nhousing, employment, the
        environment, municipal services, and land use, and it establishes a new&#13;\nmunicipal
        growth plan for the town. It articulates the Clayton community\u2019s vision
        for its future and its&#13;\nposition on land use and growth. As such it becomes
        a guide for decisions on development proposals,&#13;\nannexations, and capital

        during the 2002/2003 academic year.  The StatLab (Statistical Laboratory)
        was first established at the University of Delaware in 1983.  In the Spring
        of 1997, the lab closed its operation.  In 2001, the Statistics Program left
        the Mathematics Department and moved into the Department of Food and Resource
        Economics.  As part of this move the graduate program in statistics was re-established
        as was the StatLab.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-03-24T19:47:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-03-24T19:47:52Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2003-08</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        report summarizes the performance of the Christina School District (CSD) on
        the 2003 Delaware State Testing Program (DSTP).  The 2003 test data represent
        the final set of results attributable to CSD's former leadership team, which
        was replaced in July of 2003.  The DSTP tests all public school 3rd, 5th,
        8th and 10th graders in three areas:  reading, math and writing.  Despite
        its adequate resources, CSD has generally lagged behind most other school
        districts in Delaware in student DSTP performance.  There is a persistent
        drop-off in student performance between 3rd and 5th grades, due in part to
        a significant exodus of high-performing 5th grade students to non-CSD schools,
        and there is little or no recovery in student performance levels between the
        5th and 10th grade tests.  The 2003 results identify schools and curriculum
        areas in particular need of improvement.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-03-24T19:58:45Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-03-24T19:58:45Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2004-01</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        this project, a predictive time model was developed for an Anglia Autoflow
        mechanical chicken catching system.  At the completion of poultry growout,
        hand labor is currently used to collect the birds from the house, although
        some integrators are beginning to incorporate mechanical catching equipment.
        \ Several regression models were investigated with the objective of predicting
        the time taken to catch the chicken.  A regression model relating distance
        to total time (sum of packing time, catching time, movement to catching and
        movement to packing) provided the best performance.  The model was based on
        data collected from poultry farms on the Delmarva Peninsula during a six-month
        period.  Statistical Analysis System (SAS) and NeuroShell Easy Predictor were
        used to build the regression and neural network models respectively.  Model
        adequacy was established by both visual inspection and statistical techniques.
        \ The models were validated with experimental results not incorporated into
        the initial model.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-03-24T20:30:46Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-03-24T20:30:46Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2003-10</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        have always captured human imagination.  Throughout the Old Testament, the
        frequency with which disasters are used as central or as incidental themes
        suggests that they have always been familiar to man's experience and that
        they conveyed meanings beyond the significance of the events themselves.  Even
        today, a close examination of the news media forces one to the conclusion
        that disasters continue to be \"newsworthy.\"&#13;\n&#13;\nThis special issue
        of the American Behavioral Scientist focuses on organizational and group behavior
        in disaster.  The papers represent one attempt to deal with behavior in the
        crises event called disaster.  They concern themselves with problems as old
        as man but ones which have had only sporadic and isolated social science attention.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-04-05T12:10:22Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-04-05T12:10:22Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1970</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Article</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>American

        can we better understand, explain, and predict group and organizational responses
        to disasters?  Such questions are not ulike many others that social scientists
        ask.  Hence, the methodological probalems confronted by persons studying disaster
        responses are for the most part similar to problems confronted by those analyzing
        other social phenomena.  There is neither a special set of strategies which
        might be referred to as disaster methodology nor a spearate set of techniques
        which might be labeled disaster research methods.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-04-05T12:16:04Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-04-05T12:16:04Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1970</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Article</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>American

        Franklin's Accounts through 1747</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Lemay, J. A. Leo</dc:creator>\n<dc:description>This
        volume attempts to gather together Franklin\u2019s surviving accounts before
        1748. On 1 January 1748, he entered into partnership with David Hall and retired
        as a printer, though he remained to some degree active as a publisher. Therefore,
        the beginning of 1748 is a logical break in his accounts. Further, as we shall
        see, the three early major account books go through 1747. The accounts are
        sporadic before 1730, when the first account book begins to list all the cash
        purchases.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-04-21T23:51:17Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-04-21T23:51:17Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-04</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Book

        Miller used the accounts extensively, and the editors of The Papers of Benjamin
        Franklin have described and utilized them in that splendid edition. Eddy printed
        selections from Ledger A&amp;B and Ledger D (see the Sigla for full references).
        C. William Miller employed the accounts in his bibliography, Benjamin Franklin\u2019s

        data from five community crises, this study analyzes the conditions that facilitate
        the development of emergent groups in stress situations. We compare the empirical
        evidence from three community emergencies in which there was group emergence
        with empirical evidence from two community emergencies in which there was
        no group emergence. It is postulated that the conditions conducive to the
        generation of new groups in community disasters can be classified in a three-fold
        typology: (1) social-psychological conduciveness; (2) cultural conduciveness;
        and (3) structural conduciveness. We anticipate that the findings of this
        research will expand and extend collective behavior theory through devoting
        attention to the origins of collective behavior, an area which has received
        little prior emphasis.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-04-27T19:59:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-04-27T19:59:06Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>1969</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/2366</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        Disasters of the 21st Century: A Mixture of New, Old, and Mixed Types</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Quarantelli,
        E. L.</dc:creator>\n<dc:subject>Computer Technology</dc:subject>\n<dc:subject>Disaster
        Research</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>Disasters are as old as when human
        beings started to live in groups. Initially the hazards, which created the
        possibility for disasters, were primarily natural hazards such as earthquake
        and floods. But through time, technological risks were added to the natural
        ones. For example, the development of synthetic chemicals in the 19th Century
        and nuclear power in the 20th Century, created the possibility of toxic chemical
        disasters and radiation fallout crises. This paper suggests we are at another
        historical juncture with the appearance of a new category of disasters, what
        we call trans-system social ruptures (TSSR). The label tries to indicate that
        these kinds of disasters jump to or cut across different social systems. Using
        examples such as the spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) and the
        SoBig computer F virus, both in 2003, we describe in ideal type terms the
        primary characteristics of TSSR. We also discuss examples of future TSSR especially
        those rooted in biotechnological advances and the spread of globalization
        that create new social networks. The paper concludes with an effort to place
        TSSR within the full range of disasters, including old and traditional manifestations
        as well as ones with mixed old and new characteristics.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-05-17T17:41:47Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-05-17T17:41:47Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Other</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/2374</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>en_US</dc:language>\n<dc:relation>Preliminary

        These varied understandings of what systemic change involves, and consequently
        how long it should take, are weighty issues. They have driven, directly or
        indirectly, much of the state\u2019s past, as well as its current policymaking:
        its laws, its regulations,&#13;\nand its local policies. This study explores
        these differing views and some of the policies and programs that have subsequently
        evolved. Most importantly, the study examines the path&#13;\nDelaware has
        taken over the past ten years as influenced by various interpretations of

        reform.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-06-22T12:16:14Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-06-22T12:16:14Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2000-05</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        assessments raises concerns that some high school students who do not perform
        well on standards-based tests may leave school without academic credentials,
        or they may choose to drop out rather than receive only a certificate of attendance.
        Local educators proposed addressing these concerns by capitalizing on the
        potential overlap between K-12 and adult education academic standards. It
        was hoped that by using an established adult education certification process
        (CEAs) to document students' increasing&#13;\nacademic skills at multiple
        points in their high school careers, students might be more motivated&#13;\nto
        stay in school and continue to pursue a diploma. Because little was known
        about the potential benefits and consequences of instituting such a use of
        CEAs within the current K-12 system of standards and accountability assessment,
        this study addressed two major questions.&#13;\n1)Did students, parents, teachers,
        and school administrators consider CEAs to be an acceptable&#13;\nmethod for
        documenting student achievement and progress on the Delaware Content&#13;\nStandards?&#13;\n2)How
        feasible was it for school staff to gather and evaluate CEA assessment materials?&#13;\nthe
        concept of CEAs for in-school youth generated positive comments from&#13;\nStudents,
        parents, teachers and administrators. However, participants identified problems
        with&#13;\nfeasibility and raised concerns about implementation contexts and
        target groups.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-06-22T12:47:46Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-06-22T12:47:46Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2000-09</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) was conducted in
        1995 and was the most comprehensive international study of student performance
        and schools ever conducted examining fourth, eighth, and twelfth grades. Classroom
        video data were also collected in Germany, Japan, and the United States. The
        TIMSS-R conducted in 1999 collected only data for eighth grade students and
        their schools. This provides longitudinal data for the students in fourth
        grade in 1995 and eighth grade in 1999. In addition to student performance
        data in mathematics and science, the study also collected survey data from
        the students, teachers, and administrators, to provide a context for students\u2019
        performance. The survey questions addressed issues ranging from curriculum
        content and instructional practice to beliefs about learning and issues of
        school climate.&#13;\nThis report provides the data analysis completed with
        a grant from the Delaware Foundation for Science and Mathematics Education.
        Six research questions were explored:&#13;\n1. How does Delaware\u2019s student
        performance compare with other various States and consortia in mathematics
        and science, in the specific content strands, and on individual assessment
        items?&#13;\n2. How is student performance on the TIMSS-R related to performance
        on the DSTP across students\u2019 ethnicity?&#13;\n3. How do Delaware students\u2019
        beliefs about their education and out of class activities compare with other
        States and consortia?&#13;\n4. How do Delaware students describe their classroom
        experience?&#13;\n5. How do Delaware teachers compare with other States and
        consortia?&#13;\n6. How do teachers and students describe what goes on in
        their classroom?</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-06-22T12:59:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-06-22T12:59:05Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2001-05-29</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        by the Delaware Education Research and Development Center, includes a description
        of a group of students who participated in the Safe Pathways program since
        it started in 1999. &#13;\nInformation related to student characteristics,
        student achievement, student behavioral and attitudinal indices, and parent
        involvement is presented and discussed.&#13;\nThe data examined in this study
        describe three-year cohort participants from several angles. Student-surveys,
        teacher surveys, achievement data, and school records paint a somewhat mixed
        picture of their educational experience, and the impact the Safe Pathways
        program has had on long-term participants. Both students and teachers reported
        that the program has had some positive impact on student behaviors and attitudes.
        Achievement data were either insufficient to comment on, or indicated a small
        change over time for the three-year cohort. School records showed some consistent
        and differing patterns of absences and suspensions for elementary and secondary
        students. Parent involvement has also shown some changes according to students
        and teachers.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-06-22T13:56:53Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-06-22T13:56:53Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2002-07</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        of the evaluation plan, these may provide a detailed look at the program\u2019s
        impact at the student, classroom, and system levels.&#13;\n\u2022 Did Reading
        First classrooms implement high-quality scientifically based reading research
        programs that include instructional content based on the five essential components
        of reading?&#13;\n\u2022 Did Reading First classrooms implement instructional
        designs that include explicit instructional strategies, coordinated instructional
        sequences, ample practice opportunities, aligned student materials, ongoing
        assessment, small, flexible groups and dedicated blocks of reading time?&#13;\n\u2022
        What changes in the teachers\u2019 reading pedagogy are evident? What is the
        structure of the reading lesson? How is the classroom set up? How are students
        grouped?</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-06-29T18:30:16Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-06-29T18:30:16Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-03</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        policy in America today, No Child Left Behind, has the federal Reading First
        program as its model for early literacy instruction. Within this context,
        the Delaware Department of Education faces the challenge of advising and guiding
        those districts struggling to make reading progress. Delaware\u2019s Reading
        First (DE RF) proposes to effect widespread change through teacher training
        in Scientifically Based Reading Research (SBRR) practices. As part of the
        DE RF program evaluation, this Delaware Educator Poll examines the practices
        and beliefs of Delaware\u2019s kindergarten to third grade teachers regarding
        SBRR and the literacy component of their teacher education and training.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-06-29T18:31:00Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-06-29T18:31:00Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-04</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        constructive approach is presented to treat an initial boundary value problem
        for isothermal Navier Stokes equations. It is based on a characteristics (Lagrangean)
        approximation locally in time and a boundary intergral equation method via
        nonstationary potentials. As a basic problem, the later leads to a Volterra
        integral equation of the first kind which is proved to be uniquely solvable

        paper is concerned with the application of the Newton-imbedding&#13;\niteration
        procedure to nonlinear boundary value problems in Sobolev&#13;\nspaces. A
        simple model problem for the second-order semilinear elliptic&#13;\nequations
        is considered to illustrate the main idea. The essence&#13;\nof the method
        hinges on the a priori estimates of solutions of the associated&#13;\nlinear
        problem in appropriate Sobolev spaces. It is to our&#13;\nsurprise that H1(\u03A9)-solution
        is not smooth enough to guarantee the&#13;\nconvergence of the sequence generated
        by the procedure. Existence&#13;\nand uniqueness of solution to the original
        nonlinear problem are established&#13;\nconstructively. An application of
        this approach to the Lam\xE9&#13;\nsystem with nonlinear body force and its
        generalization to contain a&#13;\nnonlinear surface traction in elasticity
        will also be discussed.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-07-12T13:54:38Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-07-12T13:54:38Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-07-12T13:54:38Z</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        a boundary-field equation approach to a class of&#13;\nboundary value problems
        exterior to a thin domain. A prototype of this kind of problems is the interaction
        problem with a thin elastic structure. We are interested in the&#13;\nasymptotic
        behavior of the solution when the thickness of the elastic structure approaches
        to zero. In particular, formal asymptotic expansions will be developed, and&#13;\ntheir
        rigorous justification will be considered. As will be seen, the construction
        of these&#13;\nformal expansions hinges on the solutions of a sequence of
        exterior Dirichlet problems,&#13;\nwhich can be treated by employing boundary
        element methods. On the other hand,&#13;\nthe justification of the corresponding
        formal procedure requires an independence on&#13;\nthe thickness of the thin
        domain for the constant in the Korn inequality. It is shown&#13;\nthat in
        spite of the reduction of the dimensionality of the domain under consideration,&#13;\nthis
        class of problems are in general not singular perturbation problems, because
        of&#13;\nappropriate interface conditions.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-07-12T14:01:23Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-07-12T14:01:23Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-07-12T14:01:23Z</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Technical

        into a society there is always a differential rate in which individuals and
        groups within that society begin to fully utilize the technology. This unequal
        rate of technological diffusion can occur for numerous social, political,
        geographic, and economic reasons (DiMaggio, 360; Rogers, 469). In this paper,
        we use diffusion inequality theories to better understand how weather detection
        technology is being employed by Oklahoma emergency managers. An analysis of
        35 in-depth interviews with emergency managers (EMs) is used to determine
        the current ability of EMs to access weather detection radar technology as
        well as the potential impact that future advancements in radar technology
        may have on these EMs. Findings suggest the prevalence of digital inequality
        among Oklahoma emergency managers. The social and policy implications of these
        findings are discussed.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2006-07-19T13:35:13Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006-07-19T13:35:13Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2006</dc:date>\n<dc:type>Working

        preservation policy for the&#13;\ndesigned historic landscape, one of many
        categories of&#13;\nlandscapes regarded as cultural resources worthy of&#13;\npreservation
        efforts. The designed historic landscape is a work of art, created by a recognized
        master in a unique setting and time period. Its preservation depends on a&#13;\nclear
        understanding of that creator\u2019s intentions.&#13;\nA model for developing
        preservation policy was created using information from the museum field, landscape
        architecture history and the preservation movement. Using&#13;\na series of
        questions which define significance, establish authority, examine record-keeping
        procedures and specify use&#13;\nof the landscape, the model is a tool for
        writing preservation policy. Questions are used to provoke discussion and
        create understanding of the individual site&#13;\nbeing examined. The document
        produced in answering the questions considers preservation of design intent
        as the&#13;\ncritical factor in management decisions.&#13;\n&#13;\nAdvisor:

        the state of horticultural therapy programs across the United States and to
        outline the possibilities &#13;\nfor horticulture to complement existing forms

        quiet.&#13;\nBased on the results of this study, a manual of horticultural

        were notified of vacancies, when districts extended&#13;\ncontracts, which
        teaching and non-teaching positions were difficult to fill, and&#13;\nrecruitment

        and the hiring of speech pathologists.  This year\u2019s survey, the fifth
