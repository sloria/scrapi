        <dc:description>Wireless networks can be broadly classified into two types\
        \ - infrastructure based networks and ad hoc networks. The former uses fixed\
        \ base stations (infrastructure) which are responsible for coordinating communication\
        \ between the mobile hosts (nodes). These base stations are interconnected\
        \ by wired back bones, where as mobile nodes communicate with the base station\
        \ through the wireless media. The latter one consists of mobile nodes which\
        \ communicate with each other through wireless medium without any fixed infrastructure.\
        \ Hence there is no centralized infrastructure that takes care of the routing\
        \ of information among the participants in the network. There has been a growing\
        \ interest in ad hoc network in recent years as mobile devices have become\
        \ more powerful and are capable of processing data like their desktop counterparts.\
        \ When such a capability is available these devices should be able to share\
        \ information among them without reliance on existing network infrastructure.\
        \ Mobile devices are self configurable into either infrastructure or ad hoc\
        \ mode. Protocols and software have been developed to enable mobile devices\
        \ to connect to an infrastructure node, where as the same is not the case\
        \ in the ad hoc environment. Host mobility causes frequent and unpredictable\
        \ topological changes in a wireless environment. Finding and maintaining routes\
        \ in ad hoc networks is a non trivial task. This thesis will develop collaborative\
        \ services in an ad hoc (802.11) wireless environment.</dc:description>\n\

        Human body motion tracking using inertial sensors requires an attitude estimation\
        \ filter capable of tracking in all orientations. One way to represent orientation\
        \ is to use Euler angles, but they have singularities and therefore are not\
        \ suitable for human body tracking applications. Quaternions can be used to\
        \ represent orientation without incurring singularities. A quaternion-based\

        \ thesis. Also, a new suboptimal algorithm to compute the quaternions based\
        \ on magnetometer and accelerometer data is implemented. This new algorithm\
        \ called \"Factored Quaternion Algorithm\" is computationally simpler than\
        \ previous methods and provides a decoupling property from magnetometer and\

        <dc:description>The extreme strain, strain rate and temperature gradients\
        \ during Friction Stir Processing (FSP) render measurement of key parameters\
        \ in the stir zone infeasible with common methods. The objective of this research\
        \ was to separate the effects that temperature and deformation in an experimental\
        \ study of the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ni-AL bronze (NAB).\
        \ This was accomplished by subjecting as-cast NAB material to several isothermal\
        \ annealing and quenching treatments as well as isothermal hot rolling processes.\
        \ Sufficient material was generated to provide results and data for subsequent\
        \ optical microscopy, tensile, &amp; hardness tests. All results were then\
        \ compared to similar data collected from previous works completed here at\
        \ Naval Postgraduate School and with other DARPA FSP program participants.\
        \ During the course of this work correlations were drawn between FSP material\
        \ and the material subjected to isothermal hotworking, which may enhance our\
        \ understanding of the roles that various FSP process parameters have on the\
        \ microstructural transformation sequence within this material. The hot-rolling\
        \ study conducted here suggests that FSP process parameters leading to severe\
        \ deformation at temperatures between 950-1000 C in the NAB material provides\
        \ high ductility (elongation approximately 28%) with moderate strengths.</dc:description>\n\

        <dc:description>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' new\
        \ 802.16 standard is set to revolutionize the delivery of Broadband Wireless\
        \ Access (BWA), much as the 802.11 \"Wi-Fi\" standard transformed wireless\
        \ access to Local Area Networks. The standard describes a set of Medium Access\
        \ Controls (MAC) and Air Interfaces that cover a broad range of broadcast\
        \ frequencies and applications. As a result, manufacturers are developing\
        \ 802.16 compliant equipment for high speed point-to-point circuits and point-to-multipoint\
        \ circuits dubbed Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMANs). These networks\
        \ can span several miles and contain hundreds of subscribers. Shortly after\
        \ 802.11 \"Wi-Fi\" systems became widespread, several serious Denial of Service\
        \ (DoS) vulnerabilities inherent to the standard were discovered. This thesis\
        \ examines the MAC layer of the 802.16 standard to determine whether these\
        \ types of denial of service vulnerabilities are also present in the new standard.\
        \ Also examined are vulnerabilities that may be unique to the 802.16 standard.</dc:description>\n\

        <dc:description>Knowledge of transport parameters is important to the development\
        \ of new optoelectronic materials and devices, such as ultraviolet (UV) semiconductor\
        \ lasers and advanced solar cells. A series of experiments was performed to\
        \ measure fundamental transport parameters in luminescent semiconductor materials.\
        \ Using a technique that couples a scanning electron microscope (SEM) in spot\
        \ mode with a charge coupled display (CCD) camera, it is possible to image\
        \ the recombination of charge created at a point. The goal is to extract fundamental\
        \ transport parameters, such as minority carrier diffusion length (Ldiffusion))\
        \ and drift length (Ldrift), with high spatial resolution. Direct transport\
        \ imaging was used to study diffusion without bias and drift under a range\
        \ of applied electric fields. The recombination distribution as a function\
        \ of applied bias was imaged. For the unbiased measurements, the results showed\
        \ that for bulk n-type GaAs the spotwidth was independent of probe current\
        \ indicating the luminescence distribution is primarily a function of generation\
        \ volume and not diffusion length. For thin layer samples that could be approximated\
        \ as two dimensional (2D), it was found that the spotwidth changed as a function\
        \ of probe current indicating the potential to extract diffusion length data.\
        \ Results are compared to numerical modeling of charge transport and the feasibility\

        \ the United Kingdom, a central issue of contemporary foreign policy is whether\
        \ or not to enter into full membership of the European Monetary Union (EMU).\
        \ Membership has profound implications for the development of the European\
        \ Union (EU) and the future of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\
        \ and potentially upon the much heralded Anglo-American 'special relationship'.\
        \ On a practical level, excluding the political implications of membership,\
        \ joining the EMU means surrendering the pound sterling for the euro and in\
        \ doing so the British would also surrender control of monetary policy. This\
        \ thesis will examine the historical links between British defence and monetary\
        \ policy and argues that there are strong historical bonds that link the two\
        \ in the political psychology of Britain. This link has created for Britain\
        \ twin nationalistic icons in the pound and the military. This thesis illustrates\
        \ that a paradox exists in that membership in the EMU would improve British\
        \ defence spending and yet nationalistic forces resist membership. At the\
        \ same time, forces in Britain in favor of monetary integration, unable to\
        \ accomplish it but pressured to show they are dedicated to the project of\
        \ European integration, paradoxically commit to further defence integration\

        <dc:description>Twenty-three years ago, Israeli fighter pilots destroyed the\
        \ Osiraq nuclear reactor and made a profound statement about global nuclear\
        \ proliferation. In light of the recent preventive regime change in Iraq,\
        \ a review of this strike reveals timely lessons for future counterproliferation\
        \ actions. Using old, new, and primary source evidence, this thesis examines\
        \ Osiraq for lessons from a preventive attack on a non-conventional target.\
        \ Before attacking Osiraq, Israeli policymakers attempted diplomatic coercion\
        \ to delay Iraq's nuclear development. Concurrent with diplomatic actions,\
        \ Israeli planners developed a state of the art military plan to destroy Osiraq.\
        \ Finally, Israeli leaders weathered the international storm after the strike.\
        \ The thesis examines Israeli decisionmaking for each of these phases. The\
        \ thesis draws two conclusions. First, preventive strikes are valuable primarily\
        \ for two purposes: buying time and gaining international attention. Second,\
        \ the strike provided a one-time benefit for Israel. Subsequent strikes will\
        \ be less effective due to dispersed/hardened nuclear targets and limited\
        \ intelligence.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-03-14T17:31:45Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ as a part of their policies, but provide limited funding to the programs\
        \ when compared to the funding for forced eradication and security measures.\
        \ Existing policies have produced reductions in drug cultivation in many areas\
        \ and the Colombian government has made gains in security throughout the country,\
        \ particularly the remote rural regions. These gains make conditions in Colombia\
        \ suitable for large-scale alternative development supported by increased\
        \ funding. Both governments are addressing components of successful alternative\
        \ development programs, but funding disparities are hindering the effectiveness\
        \ of the programs. While the international and European communities are staunch\
        \ supporters of alternative development, the funding provided by them has\
        \ been limited in scope because of disagreement with the U.S.-backed eradication\
        \ policies. The U.S. and Colombian governments in conjunction with the international\
        \ community must focus more on alternative development in order to consolidate\
        \ the recent gains in democratic security.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-03-14T17:31:46Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ to information integrity in a networking environment. The primary educational\
        \ concern is the protection of stored data. Another goal was to test whether\
        \ the game engine properly simulates real world behavior. The research concluded\
        \ that it is possible to create SDFs for the CyberCIEGE game engine to teach\
        \ specifically about integrity issues. Three specific SDFs were developed\
        \ for teaching purposes. Several SDFs were developed to demonstrate the game\
        \ engine's ability to simulate real world behavior for specific, isolated\

        \ Domestic dynamics, including popular opinion and growing concern for Muslim\

        \ that influenced the leaders of France and Italy to take opposing stances\

        \ Discord in US-French relations was exacerbated by disagreements over other\

        \ thesis assesses the relative weight of these various factors in the French\
        \ and Italian decisions, and examines the interplay of the key national decisions\
        \ made by American, French and Italian leaders. The thesis concludes that\
        \ French and Italian decisions were influenced by factors in addition to the\
        \ issues in question-that is, whether the Iraqi regime had complied with the\
        \ UN Security Council resolutions calling for the elimination of weapons of\
        \ mass destruction and certain delivery means and, if not, whether the use\
        \ of force was an appropriate and justified course of action. It also concludes\
        \ that the severe damage to US-French relations may be overcome as Paris and\
        \ Washington cooperate in meeting international security responsibilities.\
        \ The European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy may face greater\

        \ be complex at high frequencies (&gt;5 kHz), and applications such as underwater\
        \ detection and communications suffer as a result. To this end, the Asian\
        \ Seas International Acoustics Experiment (ASIAEX) was conducted with funding\
        \ from the Office of Naval Research. One phase of this experiment took place\
        \ from 29 May to 9 June 2001 and focused on short-range, shallow water acoustic\
        \ propagation in the East China Sea. This thesis will be based on some of\
        \ the measurements taken during the East China Sea experiment by a team from\
        \ the Applied Physics Laboratory of the University of Washington. The environmental\
        \ parameters and array geometry used in this and previous modeling work are\
        \ as close as possible to the experiment. The objective of this thesis is\
        \ to better understand the nature of turbulent perturbations and how they\
        \ affect short-range acoustic propagation in a shallow water environment.\
        \ This will include variations in total energy of the turbulence, variations\
        \ in associated length scales, and variations in depth. In addition, the influence\
        \ of other variable factors on signal coherence will also be examined. Most\
        \ notably, variations in background sound-speed structure and source depth\
        \ variability will be included.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-03-14T17:31:46Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ the majority of influence operations have been geared toward the masses\
        \ or to very small numbers of individuals. Although marginally effective,\
        \ this approach is inadequate with respect to larger numbers of high value\

        \ of individual profiles for the purpose of psychological operations (PSYOP).\
        \ Research indicated that only a handful of software applications claimed\
        \ to provide adequate functionality to perform these tasks. Text mining via\
        \ neural networks was determined to be the best approach given the constraints\
        \ of the profile data and the desired output. Five software applications were\
        \ tested and evaluated for their ability to reproduce the results of a social\
        \ psychologist. Through statistical analysis, it was concluded that the tested\
        \ applications are not currently mature enough to produce accurate results\

        \ velocity profiles during the ONR-sponsored CBLAST-Low air-sea interaction\

        \ in the surface boundary layer, Langmuir circulations are important for naval\
        \ operations such as ASW, MCM and Amphibious operations in littoral waters.\
        \ A detection algorithm for upwelling / downwelling velocities due to Langmuir\
        \ circulations was developed. Analyses focused on long-fetch, unstratified\
        \ water column conditions with locally developed seas. The observations showed\
        \ that strong Langmuir circulations greatly reduced water column shear arising\
        \ from the tidally forced bottom boundary layer, while there was no significant\
        \ effect from the strong tidal boundary layer on the formation of Langmuir\
        \ cells. Long fetch conditions had the strongest vertical velocities with\
        \ Langmuir number 0.1-0.4, while short fetch conditions have weaker vertical\
        \ velocities with Langmuir number greater than 0.5. Cell vertical velocities\
        \ were correlated with the water friction velocity, but penetration depths\
        \ did not depend on forcing mechanisms. Spacing and penetration depths were\
        \ correlated for increasing wind speed and wave heights whereas this correlation\

        \ purpose of this thesis is to analyze data related to sleep patterns of warfighters\
        \ deployed to the Southwest Asia (SWA) Area of Operation. To this end, we\
        \ collected subjective survey data from warfighters operating in Iraq and\
        \ Kuwait from 25 August - 15 October 2003 (n = 273). Participants were asked\
        \ about unit-level sleep planning, sleep/wake patterns, and lifestyle factors.\
        \ Using the survey results, we are able to gain insight regarding the four\
        \ primary research questions: 1) Is sleep deprivation a significant problem\
        \ for forces in the SWA region; 2) Do current sleep logistics support a unit's\
        \ ability to accomplish assigned missions; 3) Are there differences in sleep\
        \ patterns between subset populations; and 4) Does the current survey method\
        \ support the research objectives. To address these questions, we used analysis\
        \ techniques such as principal components analysis, factor analysis, and parametric\
        \ and nonparametric hypothesis testing. We tested the reliability of the subjective\
        \ survey results by comparing self-reported survey data with actigraphy data\
        \ corresponding to the same time period (n = 34 paired observations). This\
        \ thesis also provides insight regarding the use of sleep logistics as a force\
        \ multiplier during continuous/sustained operations by discussing known fatigue\
        \ countermeasures and their role in improving individual and unit performance\
        \ effectiveness.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-03-14T17:31:48Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ man years of time awaiting training. Non-infantry personnel comprise 80%\
        \ of the more than 30,000 recruits shipped to Marine Corps Recruit Depots\

        \ a course schedule that includes recommended seat assignments by MOS and\
        \ gender. ELCS seeks to minimize the time awaiting training while successfully\

        <dc:description>S tasks. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) often involves repeated,\
        \ independent runs of the same models with different input parameters. A system\
        \ which is able to run many replications quickly is more useful than one in\
        \ which a single monolithic application runs quickly. A loosely coupled parallel\
        \ system is indicated. Inexpensive commodity hardware, high speed local area\
        \ networking, and open source software have created the potential to create\
        \ just such loosely coupled parallel systems. These systems are constructed\
        \ from Linux-based computers and are called Beowulf clusters. This thesis\
        \ presents an analysis of clusters in high-performance computing and establishes\
        \ a testbed implementation at the MOVES Institute. It describes the steps\
        \ necessary to create a cluster, factors to consider in selecting hardware\
        \ and software, and describes the process of creating applications that can\
        \ run on the cluster. Monitoring the running cluster and system administration\
        \ are also addressed.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-03-14T17:31:48Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ States continues to develop plans and policies to counter the threat of\
        \ terrorism, it becomes increasingly more vital to understand the entire spectrum\
        \ of the threat. Realistically assessing the capability of possible and probable\
        \ terrorist groups helps federal and state agencies to establish potential\
        \ methods and procedures for defense and maritime domain awareness. Yet, the\
        \ avenues of attack and the varieties of terrorists far outnumber the available\
        \ resources of most agencies concerned. Moreover, there have been no attacks\
        \ on homeland U.S. targets since September 11. The red team concept provides\
        \ an innovative method to examine these vulnerabilities from the terrorist\
        \ perspective. The effectiveness of a red team can be measured in various\
        \ ways and is dependent on key organizational and situational elements. In\
        \ the end, the determination of effectiveness is based on the original intentions\
        \ of the host enterprise, whether it is training, research, strategy, or analysis\
        \ or a combination. We conducted a case study to utilize the red team concept\
        \ as a tool for bringing a fresh awareness to a critical issue within the\
        \ National Strategy for Combating Terrorism. The red teams identified vulnerabilities\
        \ of possible targets, raised the awareness on the nature of terrorists, researched\
        \ potential tactics and tools, and examined existing assumptions about maritime\
        \ security. In applying the red team concept, the case study used military\
        \ officers as surrogate terrorists planning a campaign to attack port cities.\
        \ The case study effectively demonstrated the anticipated functions, while\
        \ the follow-on actions ensured that the results were distributed to the appropriate\
        \ agencies. Furthermore, civilian officials and the agencies concerned valued\
        \ the red team reports as positive insights into the current situation.</dc:description>\n\

        \ compared to published experimental measurements for GaAs solar cells of\
        \ the same dimensions. The virtual solar cell demonstrated a good correlation\

        \ study examined midshipmen perceptions of moral development at the Naval\
        \ Academy. Six focus groups comprising a total of 45 first-class midshipmen\
        \ were conducted to discover aspects of the Naval Academy experience that\
        \ have positive, neutral and negative impacts on midshipmen's moral development.\
        \ Focus group midshipmen reported that good personal examples, open-forum\
        \ discussions of ethical case studies, assuming midshipmen leadership responsibilities\
        \ and participation in sports have a positive impact on their moral development.\
        \ Parts of the Naval Academy experience that had a neutral impact on their\
        \ moral development included some aspects of the core ethics course, the behavior\
        \ of some of their peers, and the \"directed development\" approach they perceived\
        \ in many of the Academy programs. Focus group midshipmen also believed that\
        \ there were too many ethics and character programs, and that they were too\
        \ repetitious and too routine to have more than a neutral impact on their\
        \ moral development. Finally, focus group midshipmen cited bad example by\
        \ some officers, the Bancroft Hall culture, and weaknesses in the Honor System\
        \ as having a negative impact on their moral development. This study concluded\
        \ with several recommendations from the midshipmen and researcher to improve\
        \ moral development efforts at the Naval Academy.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-03-14T17:31:49Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ way that the Internet is accessed has changed dramatically in recent years.\
        \ In addition to wire line connections such as dial-up, xDSL, cable modems\
        \ or optical fiber, wireless implementations are gaining market share based\
        \ on technologies such as WiFi, WiMAX, MBWA, satellite and cell phone networks.\
        \ This thesis examines the potential usage of providing Internet access through\
        \ cellular infrastructure. The cellular evolution path from first generation\
        \ (1G) to third generation (3G) and fourth generation (4G) systems is studied\
        \ and presented. The most popular worldwide cellular voice and data network\
        \ technologies are also described. Additionally, the Cingular Wireless network\
        \ in Monterey, California is tested in terms of speed and reliability by providing\
        \ Internet access to a laptop through a mobile phone. The analysis shows that,\
        \ depending on the cellular network availability, throughput varied from 5\
        \ to 25 Kbps and Round Trip Time (RTT) averaged about 1 sec. Furthermore,\
        \ it is shown that TCP Timestamps and the Explicit Congestion Notification\
        \ (ECN) were implemented at the end hosts, thus increasing performance. The\
        \ thesis concludes that as of July 2004, the 2.5G cellular data networks are\
        \ a reasonable solution for those who need Internet access anywhere that a\
        \ cell signal is available, including from moving vehicles, and who can afford\
        \ its high cost. For others it is not yet an acceptable solution. However,\
        \ the future 3G networks are an excellent solution in wireless broadband Internet\
        \ access. These will probably be relatively expensive at first, but the cost\
        \ should eventually decrease to a reasonable level.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-03-14T17:31:53Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ significance of the Radar Cross Section (RCS) in the outcome of military\
        \ engagements makes its prediction an important problem in modern Electronic\
        \ Warfare. The POFACETS program, previously developed at the Naval Postgraduate\
        \ School (NPS), uses the Physical Optics method to predict the RCS of complex\
        \ targets, which are modeled with the use of triangular facets. The program\
        \ has minimum computer resource requirements and provides convenient run-times.\
        \ This thesis upgraded, enhanced and expanded the functionalities and capabilities\
        \ of the POFACETS program. The new functionalities were implemented by upgrading\
        \ the Graphical User Interface and model database, allowing the creation of\
        \ models with an unlimited number of facets, providing capabilities for the\
        \ automatic creation of models with standard geometric shapes, allowing the\
        \ combination of existing target models, providing capabilities for sharing\
        \ target models with commercial CAD programs, and creating new display formats\
        \ for RCS results. The new computational capabilities include the development\
        \ of a user- updateable database of materials and coatings that can be applied\
        \ to models in one or multiple layers, and the computation of their effects\
        \ on the models' RCS. Also implemented are the computations of the ground's\
        \ effect on the RCS, and the exploitation of symmetry planes in models, in\
        \ order to decrease run-time for RCS prediction.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-03-14T17:31:54Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ system. This thesis examines the critical elements this platform must possess\
        \ in order to effectively support small units operating in urban environments.\
        \ We address this issue by creating and exploring an agentbased simulation\
        \ of a platoon conducting an urban patrol in a setting similar to those currently\
        \ being encountered in Iraq. The platoon utilizes the VTUAV as an intelligence-gathering\
        \ asset. We use an efficient designed experiment to generate data from the\
        \ simulation scenario, and then use multiple regression and regression trees\
        \ to relate the UAV capabilities to the patrol's operational effectiveness.\
        \ Our results suggest that the effectiveness of a VTUAV is greatly influenced\
        \ by noise in the urban warfare environment. We use a loss function, along\
        \ with the regression models, to identify UAV configurations that improve\
        \ operational effectiveness yet are robust to uncertainties about civilian\
        \ and insurgent behavior. The VTUAV must have high communication capability,\
        \ as well as accurate sensing, in order to perform well across a range of\
        \ environmental conditions.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-03-14T17:31:55Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ the NATO Response Force (NRF) is the result of the call for NATO to create\
        \ a warfighting capability to meet the security threats of the 21st Century.\
        \ The NRF is a joint force comprised of air, land and maritime assets designed\
        \ to conduct operations across the full spectrum of conflict. Missions include\
        \ opposed entry scenarios, counter-terrorism, crisis response and peace enforcement,\
        \ embargo operations, interdiction, and human relief and non-combatant evacuations,\
        \ meeting the need called for in the U.S. National Security Strategy as well\
        \ as the European Union Security Strategy. The NRF will also serve as a catalyst\
        \ for transformation, encouraging European nations to downsize and retool\
        \ their legacy forces in order to participate in the NRF. Political influences\
        \ and operational constraints threaten to limit the NRF. The tangible effect\
        \ the NRF will have on the Air Force will be its disproportionate need for\
        \ Air Force assets to meet its required operational mandate. The result of\
        \ the EU's inability to readily address their capability shortfalls will be\
        \ the NRF's dependence upon Air Force to provide strategic airlift, air refueling,\
        \ Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and the procurement\
        \ and use of Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) for the foreseeable future.</dc:description>\n\

        <dc:contributor>National Security Affairs</dc:contributor>\n<dc:description>Since\
        \ the current policy known as \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" was adopted in the\
        \ early 1990s, several changes have taken place which call into question the\
        \ policy's validity. Firstly, the argument proponents of the ban use to justify\
        \ it, namely that cohesion would suffer if admitted homosexuals were allowed\
        \ to serve, has been undercut by social science analyses on the correlation\
        \ between cohesion and performance. Their argument has also been undercut\
        \ by empirical evidence from several nations that have lifted all restrictions\
        \ on homosexual service, yet have suffered no decrease in cohesion or performance,\
        \ despite the reticence of their respective militaries to lift the bans. At\
        \ the same time, the US public has moved toward a greater acceptance of the\
        \ notion of admitted homosexuals serving in the military, with 79% approving\
        \ in a December 2003 Gallup Poll, including 91% of all Americans age 18 -\
        \ 29. Evidence also indicates the current policy costs at least $40 million\
        \ per year just to replace those who have been discharged due to their sexual\
        \ orientation. Other costs include wasted human resources at a time of critical\
        \ shortfalls in many specialties essential to the ongoing Global War on Terror,\
        \ and the immeasurable cost of sanctioned unjustifiable discrimination by\
        \ the US Government. The time to lift all restrictions on homosexual service\
        \ in the US Armed Forces has come.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-03-14T17:31:56Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ analyzes the feasibility, functionality, efficacy and usability of IEEE\

        \ performed on the realistic implementation issues of wireless mesh networks\
        \ and their possible applications. A detailed examination is conducted of\
        \ the variable elements, operational constraints, and possible decision points\
        \ for developing a usable, robust, self-organizing, wireless mesh network\
        \ that can be leveraged for maximum usability and shared situational awareness\

        \ of currently available COTS hardware and software wireless mesh networking\
        \ components for geographically distributed networks. Additionally, a product-line\
        \ software architecture and a common data interchange XML vocabulary are proposed\

        \ networks can be broadly classified into two types - infrastructure based\
        \ networks and ad hoc networks. The former uses fixed base stations (infrastructure)\
        \ which are responsible for coordinating communication between the mobile\
        \ hosts (nodes). These base stations are interconnected by wired back bones,\
        \ where as mobile nodes communicate with the base station through the wireless\
        \ media. The latter one consists of mobile nodes which communicate with each\
        \ other through wireless medium without any fixed infrastructure. Hence there\
        \ is no centralized infrastructure that takes care of the routing of information\
        \ among the participants in the network. There has been a growing interest\
        \ in ad hoc network in recent years as mobile devices have become more powerful\
        \ and are capable of processing data like their desktop counterparts. When\
        \ such a capability is available these devices should be able to share information\
        \ among them without reliance on existing network infrastructure. Mobile devices\
        \ are self configurable into either infrastructure or ad hoc mode. Protocols\
        \ and software have been developed to enable mobile devices to connect to\
        \ an infrastructure node, where as the same is not the case in the ad hoc\
        \ environment. Host mobility causes frequent and unpredictable topological\
        \ changes in a wireless environment. Finding and maintaining routes in ad\
        \ hoc networks is a non trivial task. This thesis will develop software components\
        \ that will enable communication in an ad hoc network. These components could\
        \ be used to build collaborative services in such and ad hoc (802.11) wireless\
        \ environment.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-03-14T17:31:58Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ phenomenon. It is not restricted to any one particular religion or belief\
        \ system, nor is it reserved as a weapon against foreign lands. Domestic religious\
        \ terrorism is just as prevalent throughout history and is brought about by\
        \ certain converging factors at particularly susceptible times within the\
        \ society, such as economic difficulties, new or modified technologies, and\
        \ social uncertainties. Under these conditions, a charismatic leader with\
        \ an appealing ideology and access to sufficient resources may become a very\
        \ powerful threat to society, pitting the secular against the divine. This\
        \ type of convergence may result in altogether new religious movements, or\
        \ the unexpected growth of fringe groups that, until they act, are not even\
        \ identified. Examining the historical convergences of the Reformation, First\
        \ and Second Great Awakenings, and the trends of modern domestic society,\
        \ we find that the threads which hold these movements together remain consistent\
        \ throughout history. Enabled by the rapid growth of technology, these groups\
        \ have unprecedented potential power. A group that decides to become offensive\
        \ or use weapons of mass destruction, such as Japan's Aum Shinrikyo, may pose\

        \ analyzes the utility of military force against state-sponsored terrorism.\
        \ It explains why past military responses did not pose a credible threat and\
        \ were thus, an ineffective instrument of national power. It then examines\
        \ how military force is employed in the current war on terrorism. The findings\
        \ of this thesis suggest that the limited military strikes employed against\
        \ states for their role in terrorist attacks prior to September 11, 2001,\
        \ preconditioned the leaders of supportive states to believe U.S. leadership\
        \ lacked commitment in its strategy to end statesponsored terrorism. The findings\
        \ also suggest the dramatic change in the United States' method of employing\
        \ its military forces against state sponsors of terrorism after September\
        \ 11, 2001, created the credible, coercive military threat required to accomplish\
        \ the U.S. national objective of ending state-sponsored terrorism.</dc:description>\n\

        \ high power microwave devices suffer from a lack of reliable, reproducible\
        \ cathodes for generating the requisite GW-level electron beam in a vacuum.\
        \ Standard explosive emission cathode pulse durations have been limited to\
        \ 10's or 100's of ns due to the expansion of cathode-generated plasma and\
        \ the ensuing impedance collapse that debilitates microwave output. Traditional\
        \ thermionic cathodes do not suffer from this drawback of plasma generation,\
        \ but have not yet been able to provide the required emission current densities\
        \ explosive emission cathodes are capable of. It is expected that if the plasma\
        \ could be made cooler and less dense, explosive emission would be more stable.\
        \ Cesium iodide (CsI) has been found to slow the impedance collapse in many\
        \ explosive emission cathodes. Herein we will experimentally examine diode\
        \ impedance collapse, gas production, and cathode conditioning in an effort\
        \ to perform an evaluation of explosive cathode performance in a typical thermionic\
        \ electron gun environment. These results will then be used to help demarcate\
        \ the parameter space over which these CsI-coated carbon fiber cathodes are\
        \ viable candidates for the electron beam source in next-generation high power\
        \ microwave devices.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-03-14T17:31:59Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ treated as a linear, time - invariant, space - variant (TISV) filter or\
        \ communication channel. The filter is time - invariant because no motion\
        \ was modeled and because the properties of the ocean were assumed to be constant.\
        \ The filter is space - variant because of the presence of the two boundaries,\
        \ that is, the ocean surface and ocean bottom. This thesis investigates the\
        \ ocean as a linear TISV filter by evaluating 1) the complex frequency response,\
        \ 2) the impulse response, and 3) the transfer function of the ocean with\
        \ respect to depth. It is shown that the TISV impulse response of the ocean\
        \ contains information that can be used to help localize a target in range\
        \ and whether the target is above or below the receiver. Computer simulation\
        \ results were obtained by evaluating the three filter functions for several\

        \ indicated that there was a significant interaction between repeated measures\
        \ of mood states and gender. In addition, female participants reported significantly\
        \ higher mood scale scores than the male participants, and topside participants\
        \ were getting significantly less sleep than belowdecks participants. Given\

        \ research involves the development of a human-body motion tracking system\
        \ constructed with the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) compo-nents.\
        \ The problem to be solved is that the data from the motion tracking sensors\
        \ must be transmitted wirelessly in real time from a microcontroller to a\
        \ server computer. Due to the fact that the microcontroller does not support\
        \ a standard OS, widely used PCMCIA cards or USB wireless modules cannot be\
        \ used. The wireless communication module chosen for this purpose is the DPAC\
        \ airborne, a highly integrated 802.11b module that can be easily integrated\
        \ with the microcon-troller. The evaluation of the module was completed in\
        \ four stages. The first part was to initiate communication with the DPAC\
        \ module. The second part was to establish communication between the DPAC\
        \ module and a TCP server. The third part was to establish communication between\
        \ the microcontroller and the DPAC module. The fourth part was to increase\
        \ the baud-rate to the desired high value of 230,400 bps. The evaluation result\
        \ indicates that the DPAC airborne module meets the wireless communication\
        \ requirements of the motion tracking system.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-03-14T17:32:10Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ Results of the hierarchical logistic regression analyses validate the theoretical\

        \ participation are observed through the interaction of these two forces.\
        \ Results indicate that recruit status is significantly related to lower retention\
        \ rates, however, this negative force is counterbalanced by the positive influence\
        \ of sustained varsity athletic participation, should the athlete have the\
        \ perseverance to letter in his or her sport. This study also identifies the\
        \ walk-on varsity athlete as the true beneficiary of the human capital benefits\

        \ acquires leadership and teamwork skills attributed to participation in varsity\

        \ On-Line Game (MMOG) to deliver Weapons of Mass Destruction Training to the\
        \ nation's first responders and civilians. MMOG technology offers a cost effective\
        \ alternative to existing training methodologies. Existing first responder\
        \ WMD training often uses traditional in-residence classes. These current\
        \ training methods are expensive, lack standardization, and do not have provable\
        \ outcomes. Scaling up existing training to meet the needs of millions of\
        \ responders would be cost prohibitive. Modern information technologies such\
        \ as MMOGs offer a safe, efficient, effective and fun alternative mechanism\
        \ to deliver training. MMOGs could scale to meet the volume of training need\
        \ at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. The DoD has proven the\
        \ effectiveness of simulation games as a training tool, and the use of gaming\
        \ and simulations is recognized in academia.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-03-14T17:32:10Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ a savings in flight hours expended on functional check flights (FCF's) when\
        \ compared to present practices, if there will there be a reduction in directed\
        \ maintenance man-hours (DMMH) spent on maintenance related to the rotor system,\
        \ and the impact on Operational Availability. Experiments were conducted using\
        \ a discrete event simulation model of squadron flight operations and organizational\
        \ level maintenance. The simulation is generic and can be used in the analysis\
        \ of other helicopters. Input parameters governing the distributions of maintenance\
        \ action inter-arrival times were estimated from Naval Aviation Logistics\
        \ Data Analysis (NALDA) databases and squadron experiences on such systems.\
        \ The analysis suggests that flight hours spent in FCF are dependent upon\
        \ vibration growth rate, an unknown quantity, and the maintenance policy for\
        \ rotor smoothing. Directed maintenance man-hours decrease with increasing\
        \ numbers of IMD HUMS configured aircraft and further gains are achieved with\
        \ a maintenance policy suited to a continuous monitoring system.</dc:description>\n\

        \ thesis analyzes adverse demographic trends in the European Union, including\
        \ sub-replacement birthrates and increasing median ages. It investigates the\
        \ implications of these trends for the EU's prospects for becoming a stronger\
        \ and more influential actor in international affairs. Pressures arising from\
        \ population trends in and near the EU could ultimately affect national and\
        \ EU cohesion, governmental effectiveness, and social stability. Absent remedial\
        \ measures, social programs in some EU countries will be unsustainable due\
        \ to the mounting financial burden of pensions and health care for growing\
        \ elderly populations. Such financial obligations hinder funding other national\
        \ programs, including modernized military capabilities. Nationalism and national\
        \ identity are at issue in immigrant integration and assimilation efforts.\
        \ The role of population trends with regard to the growing threat of radical\
        \ Islamic fundamentalism is explored. The thesis concludes with policy recommendations\
        \ that might be considered to avert the looming economic, social, and security\
        \ crises that may result from these demographic trends. In short, the security\
        \ and financial consequences foreshadowed by the current demographic trends\
        \ of an aging, economically weaker, and socially conflicted European Union\
        \ could present dramatic implications for the vital national interests of\

        \ this problem were developed, and the insight obtained from examination was\
        \ applied in developing controllers for the system. This control system controlled\
        \ the orientation of the camera to keep it constantly pointing at the target,\
        \ and also controlled the trajectory of the aircraft in flight around the\
        \ target. The initial control law that was developed drives the aircraft trajectory\
        \ to a constant radius around the target. The range to the target is not directly\
        \ measurable, so it was estimated using steady state Kalman filters. Once\
        \ a range estimate is obtained, it is used to control the range to the target,\
        \ and the aircraft trajectory is driven toward a circle with a specified radius.\
        \ Initial tests of the control system with Simulink simulations have shown\
        \ good performance of the control system. Further testing with hardware will\
        \ be conducted, and flight tests are scheduled to be conducted in the near\

        <dc:description>NPSAT1 will be launched as a secondary payload on the Evolved\
        \ Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Atlas V. The Atlas V will provide a medium\

        \ as in-flight operations prior to and shortly after separation from the launch\
        \ vehicle. All hazards associated with NPSAT1 are to be enumerated and assessed\

        \ cynicism is an attitude, characterized by frustration and negatively valenced\

        \ cynicism at the United States Naval Academy. The study is based on focus\
        \ groups involving 30 first class midshipmen (i.e., seniors). Gaps in expectations\
        \ versus students' reality emerged as a cause of organizational cynicism.\
        \ Themes such as (1) constraints on decision-making discretion, (2) disappointment\
        \ in peers' actions, (3) organizational inconsistencies, and (4) emphasis\
        \ on outside interests versus midshipmen's interests emerged as the strongest\
        \ precursors to the development of cynicism. The effects of organizational\
        \ cynicism were reported as (1) lack of organizational commitment and citizenship\
        \ and (2) deficiencies in decision-making and risk taking skills.</dc:description>\n\

        \ to South America because of the characterization of this zone of the Western\
        \ Hemisphere as a zone with a \"long peace\". However, almost 200 years after\
        \ achieving independence from Spain and Portugal, some countries are still\
        \ facing unsolved territorial and boundary disputes. Thus, the purpose of\
        \ this thesis is to assess the importance the balance of power has in the\
        \ inter-state relationships in the Western Hemisphere. This thesis argues\
        \ that Plan Colombia is creating an imbalance of military power between Colombia\
        \ and Venezuela and this balance is important to their relations. Three possible\
        \ explanations are used to explore the relations between these two countries,\
        \ which are democratic peace, balance of power, and spiral model. The major\
        \ conclusion of this thesis is that the implementation of U.S. policy in the\
        \ region is creating an imbalance of power, and that the situation could lead\
        \ the unbalanced country to increase military capabilities. The long history\
        \ of misperceptions of the capabilities and intentions of the adversary could\
        \ provide the dynamics that might trigger a war. Therefore, this U.S. policy\
        \ is likely to increase tensions and instability in the dyad.</dc:description>\n\

        \ the process of the European implementation of a Common Foreign and Security\
        \ Policy (CFSP) at Maastricht in December 1991 until the Franco-British declaration\
        \ on European defense at Saint-Ml\xCC o in December 1998, the EU's European\
        \ Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) etched out the initial concept of a European\
        \ Pillar within the framework of NATO expressed in NATO's European Security\
        \ and Defense Identity (ESDI). The Franco-British declaration at Saint- Ml\xCC\
        \ o demonstrated the willingness of some EU member states to promote autonomous\
        \ military capabilities within the EU that enables the EU to act outside of\
        \ NATO's framework. The further development of ESDP led to concern among NATO\
        \ officials and US diplomats regarding ESDP's potential challenging appearance\
        \ to NATO. US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld expressed this concern about\
        \ a growing EU opposition to the transatlantic policy of alliance. In January\
        \ 2003, during the Iraq Crisis, Mr. Rumsfeld labeled France and Germany as\
        \ the \"Old Europe\". The relation of ESDP to NATO is strongly affected by\
        \ the national interests of leading European actors like France and Germany.\
        \ The development of ESDP as either a competitor or support arm of NATO depends\
        \ on whether the French or the German approach to European security becomes\
        \ dominant.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-03-14T17:32:12Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2012-03-14T17:32:12Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ Bay. Experimentation with the REMUS as a mine detection asset was also performed.\
        \ The design and development of the mine hunting experiment is discussed as\
        \ well as its results and their analysis. Of particular interest in this portion\

        <dc:description>In 2001 the USS WINSTON CHURCHILL (DDG-81) was subjected to\
        \ three underwater explosions as part of a ship shock trial. Using the actual\
        \ trial data from experiment and three-dimensional dynamic models of the ship\
        \ and surrounding fluid very successful comparisons of the vertical motion\
        \ have been achieved. On average, the magnitude of the vertical motion is\
        \ three to four times the magnitude of athwartship motion. Previous simulations\
        \ of this athwartship motion have been less accurate than the vertical motion\
        \ simulations. This thesis examines recent efforts attempted to improve the\
        \ simulation results of the athwartship motion including shock spectra analysis,\

        \ nuclear weapons has shaken the foundations of U.S. policy in Northeast Asia.\
        \ Because of North Korea's record of state-sponsored terrorism, illicit activities,\
        \ human rights violations, arms sales, and fiery rhetoric, its development\
        \ of operational nuclear weapons is deeply disturbing. Although most agree\
        \ North Korea should not possess nuclear weapons, nobody has a solution. This\
        \ thesis evaluates three U.S. policy options for North Korean nuclear weapons:\
        \ incentive-based diplomacy, coercive diplomacy, or military force. It analyzes\
        \ them according to four criteria: the impact on North Korea's nuclear weapons,\
        \ the impact on its neighbors (China, Japan, and South Korea), U.S. policy\
        \ costs, and the precedent for future proliferation. This thesis shows that\
        \ diplomacy will fail to achieve U.S. objectives for three reasons: lack of\
        \ trust, DPRK reluctance to permit transparency, and the difficulty of conducting\
        \ multilateral coercive diplomacy. Ultimately, Deputy Secretary of State Richard\
        \ Armitage's question must be answered: \"What price is the United States\
        \ willing to pay to disarm North Korean nuclear weapons?\" If Washington is\
        \ unwilling to back a threat of military force, it should not risk coercive\
        \ diplomacy. Likewise, U.S. leaders may need to decide between maintaining\
        \ the U.S.-ROK alliance and eliminating North Korean nuclear weapons.</dc:description>\n\

        \ midshipman. While not previously discussed in literature, there are an abundance\
        \ of studies on civilian recruiting and orientation programs, as well as realistic\
        \ job previews and expectation-lowering procedures. Based on this literature,\

        \ quality point ratings, as well as increased military and physical performance.\
        \ This hypothesis was tested using multiple hierarchical regressions on population\

        \ using seven dependent variables organized by academic, military, and physical\
        \ performance. The key independent variable is participation in the Summer\
        \ Seminar program, while eleven other independent variables control for demographics,\
        \ selection criteria, and proven indicators of success. Participation in the\
        \ Summer Seminar program had a significant relation to increased graduation\
        \ rates, increased academic cumulative quality point ratings, increased military\
        \ cumulative quality point ratings, and increased physical readiness test\
        \ scores. This study concludes that the Summer Seminar program makes a unique\
        \ contribution to midshipman success at the Naval Academy.</dc:description>\n\

        \ Current US Army Doctrine focuses entirely on the Counterguerilla aspect\

        \ not only is the COIN doctrine is inadequate, it also requires an overall\
        \ governing strategy which must include the engagements of both the populace,\
        \ and the infrastructure of the insurgency, as well as counterforce operations\

        \ favor of the conventional units who write it. Currently all COIN operations\
        \ fall under Support and Stability Operations, as do Counterguerrilla Operations\
        \ in doctrinal hierarchy that is written by the US Army Infantry Branch. However,\
        \ US Army Special Forces Branch writes Insurgency and Foreign Internal Defense\
        \ Doctrine (COIN falls under FID for all Internal Defense and Development\
        \ [IDAD] Programs). The unique qualifications of Special Forces units make\
        \ them ideal for creating, developing, instituting, and commanding these operations.\

        \ Instruction 7000.14-R, paragraph 0716, prescribes the methods that will\
        \ be used to determine the price of DOD publications when they are sold to\
        \ foreign military sales (FMS) customers. The Instruction includes publication\
        \ pricing factors that shall be included in the development of FMS prices\
        \ for paper publications. When technical data was maintained and distributed\
        \ primarily by paper form, pricing the product to recover the associated costs\
        \ was a relatively reasonable and reliable process. As we transition from\
        \ paper to electronic data encompassed in various media and arrangements,\
        \ the costs associated with this migration will differ considerably. As electronic\
        \ storage and presentation of digital data becomes more interactive with the\
        \ internet, the association between the existing practices and advanced products\
        \ become more contradictory. The historical pricing procedures will no longer\
        \ reflect the costs that need to be recovered. In this era of digital data\
        \ and computerized integration, new technological advances have increased\
        \ the demand and cost of services associated with digitization of paper documents.\
        \ With the introduction of these new technologies, various fees associated\
        \ with this transformation have to be incorporated into the pricing structure\
        \ that currently exists. The problem that exists with the incorporation of\
        \ these fees is the lack of long-term historical data due to relative infancy\
        \ of the goods and services linked to this technology. The primary objective\
        \ of this project is to determine accurate and justifiable pricing for the\
        \ foreign military sale of electronic technical manuals under the guiding\
        \ principles of DOD Instruction 7000.14-R.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-08-22T15:30:41Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ Initiative (MHPI) represents a dramatic revision in the construction and\
        \ maintenance of military housing. The Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) initiative\
        \ is also a long waited major step towards providing an adequate quantity\
        \ and quality of living quarters for service members and their families. This\
        \ MBA compares MHPI to the other two family housing programs, such as military\
        \ construction (MILCON) and BAH and analyzes the interrelationship among them.\
        \ This project studied the examples of the Presidio of Monterey/NPS and the\
        \ Hickam AFB housing privatization projects in details. The research concludes\
        \ that MHPI is a valuable and flexible tool for bridging the gap between existing\
        \ housing needs and what the Government has been able to provide through traditional\
        \ military construction. Since many long-term uncertainties exist regarding\
        \ DOD's future housing needs and the resulting effect of the BAH initiative,\
        \ this project recommends capitalizing on the strength of each housing tool\
        \ (BAH, MHPI) through a more integrated approach to ensure that the military's\
        \ housing needs are met as efficiently as possible. A better coordination\
        \ on housing initiatives appear to be important, since housing allowances\
        \ could rise in some areas, thereby making more local housing affordable to\
        \ service members and lessening the need for renovation and construction.\
        \ Greater adherence to policy of coordination is needed if DOD is to avoid\
        \ building or revitalizing more housing than is needed under both military\
        \ construction and privatization programs.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-08-22T15:30:41Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ This thesis will examine U.S. efforts between 1986 and 2004 to convince\
        \ Libya to cease its support for international terrorism and weapons of mass\
        \ destruction (WMD). U.S. influence strategy towards Libya was a short term\

        \ served to isolate Libya economically and diplomatically and set the conditions\
        \ for successful conditional engagement. Positive behavior change by Libya\
        \ began first with the Clinton Administration's introduction of conditional\
        \ engagement. The Bush Administration, benefiting from years of Libyan isolation\
        \ and the positive response to conditional engagement, continued to engage\
        \ Libya in an incremental fashion. Libya renounced its terrorist ties in August\
        \ 2003 and weapons of mass destruction in December 2003. Since then Tripoli\
        \ has taken actionable steps to verify this change of policy and both governments\
        \ are currently on course for reconciliation.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2012-08-22T15:30:44Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ its opportunity of arriving on the scene at an earlier time. The use of\

        <dc:contributor>Computer Science</dc:contributor>\n<dc:description>Today it\
        \ is important for Navy ships at sea to be able to communicate and exchange\
        \ information with a shore network for services such as file transfer, database\
        \ access, e-mail, web/intranet browsing or video conferencing.  To accomplish\
        \ this, most ships use satellite communications, which is an expensive and\
        \ slow method.  When a ship is near shore, it can use alternate methods of\
        \ communicating with the shore network, which are typically faster and cost\
        \ less than  satellite-based services.  Examples of these methods are IEEE\
        \ 802.15, WIMAX, 2G/3G cellular networks and Wave Relay systems. This paper\
        \ evaluates the various methods available in terms of cost, range, bandwidth,\
        \ quality of service (QoS) and reliability, by conducting experiments in Monterey\
        \ Bay, CA.  The experimental results are reported and used in this paper to\
        \ determine which methods would be best suited for various use cases.</dc:description>\n\

        <dc:description>In this paper we consider the phenomenon and functionality\
        \ of a memory system capable of supporting collective expert networks.  In\
        \ this instance, we apply the context of networked decision support to a maritime\
        \ interdiction operation (MIO).  There are two dimensions of knowledge in\
        \ such networked decision support systems (NWDSS): social or organizational\
        \ memory as exemplified by reach back to subject matter experts, and software\
        \ encoded knowledge bases distributed across a MIO services network.  We consider\
        \ a transactive memory system (TMS) as a mechanism unifying network knowledge\
        \ flow, formation and sharing.  In the context of MIO, the TMS is considered\
        \ as a knowledge network that forms and evolves through the process of discovery\
        \ and formation of strong and wek ties between the information sensors and\
        \ expert nodes producing shared analyses.  WE examine the nature of bursts\
        \ and clustering in social networking between mobile operators and reachback\
        \ expeters, and describe the potential architecture of a human-machine \"\
        cortex\" ysing a MIO-related social network.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2013-11-20T16:03:01Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>The movement to understand the nature of Unconventional Warfare\
        \ through the lens of Special Movement Theory is a continuing&#13;\neffort.\
        \ Since the article \u201CA Social Movement Approach to UW\u201D appeared\
        \ in Special Warfare Magazine, last year, the concept has&#13;\nreceived a\
        \ healthy dose of positive and critical feedback.[i] While the uprisings during\
        \ the Arab Spring demonstrated the enduring&#13;\nutility of civil unrest\
        \ in bringing about political change, the crisis in Ukraine forced us to sharpen\
        \ our understanding of how to fuse&#13;\ncivil unrest with unconventional\
        \ warfare. Earlier this year, looking for ways to understand the contemporary\
        \ threats and challenges,&#13;\nSOCOM FMD asked a series of questions about\
        \ how to operationalize the social movement approach. In this article, we\
        \ will attempt&#13;\nto answer those questions and share some insight of this\
        \ approach which can provide a framework of how to leverage existing&#13;\n\
        opposition movements in support of an unconventional warfare (UW) campaign.</dc:description>\n\
