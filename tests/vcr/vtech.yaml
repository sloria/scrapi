        <dc:description>It is projected that the majority population will become the\
        \ minority population by 2050. In order to serve the needs of an ethnically\
        \ diverse U.S. population, corporate agribusinesses are encouraged to employ\
        \ an ethnically diverse workforce. The purpose of this research was to understand\
        \ how attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control in the\
        \ workplace affects the intent of underrepresented groups to remain in working\
        \ for their current corporate  agribusiness. In current agriculture research,\
        \ there are very few studies that focus on the experiences of underrepresented\
        \ groups in corporate agribusinesses. There is also very little research and\
        \ public information that provides the number of underrepresented students\
        \ who are recruited and retained in corporate agribusinesses from year to\
        \ year.  For this reason the author sought to explore the experiences of underrepresented\
        \ groups who work for agricultural organizations and gain an understanding\
        \ of factors that impact their intentions to maintain a career in the field.\
        \ \nUsing a phenomenological qualitative research study design, individual\
        \ interviews were conducted with underrepresented employees from various corporate\
        \ agribusinesses from across the United States. A review of the findings indicate\
        \ that underrepresented groups who work for corporate agribusinesses are satisfied\
        \ with their jobs in terms of compensation, work/life balance, and the opportunities\
        \ for advancement. Yet, they are sometimes faced with micro-aggressions, at\
        \ times feel they are treated differently because of their race, and often\
        \ work in cultural climates that lack inclusion and/or cultural intelligence.\
        \ As a result the majority of the participants who participated in the study\
        \ felt that they would remain with their corporate agribusiness employer until\
        \ they found a new company to work for, started their own business, or a better\
        \ opportunity presented itself.  \n The findings from this study also show\
        \ that anyone seeking employment in corporate agribusinesses need to have\
        \ effective communication skills, cultural and emotional intelligence, agricultural\
        \ competency, and a true passion for their field of agriculture in order to\
        \ be successful in the industry. Other findings show that underrepresented\
        \ groups and their White counterparts need to be educated on the contributions\
        \ that underrepresented groups have made to the agricultural field in efforts\
        \ to change the negative perceptions that underrepresented groups have about\
        \ agriculture.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>MSLFS</dc:description>\n\
