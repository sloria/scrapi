        <dc:description>This study conducted with the aim of showing status of rural\
        \ women land right in Africa in general with special focus in Ethiopia. It\
        \ addressed the case of Ethiopian rural women by taking the case of rural\
        \ women in Mojana Wodera Woreda, Amhara Regional National State. Thus it posed\
        \ four basic research questions\u1361 how do current Ethiopian land laws positively\
        \ or negatively affect rural women\u201Fs land rights? What land rights do\
        \ rural women enjoy in Ethiopia compared with those enjoyed by rural women\
        \ in Nigeria, Uganda, Rwanda and Mozambique? What are the challenges faced\
        \ by rural women within the remit of their land rights? What is the role of\
        \ customary land laws and the interplay with modern/statutory land laws? In\
        \ order to answer these questions, data was collected from oral and written\
        \ sources. The analysis of these data show rural women in Ethiopia have enjoyed\
        \ legal equality regarding their land rights but there exist implementation\
        \ gaps. In practice rural women are not benefiting at most pertaining to societal\
        \ and institutional failures. It is also true for other African fellows. African\
        \ women share a marginalized and secondary land rights. There are undeniable\
        \ positive way outs like land registration and titling which have brought\
        \ reforms in rural women status with some unwanted drawbacks. Therefore, the\
        \ study recommended abolition of illiteracy, community awareness raising,\
        \ promotion and enforcement of women land right and strengthening government\
        \ task forces.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-10-22T08:04:27Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ been in a state of crises since independence, primarily linked to external\
        \ influences which have social, cultural, economic, and political dimensions.\
        \ The African states, not all, suffered the extreme consequences from unviable\
        \ forms of political rule which criminalized both the state and the economy\
        \ and produced ethnic contention and deeply divided society. The external\
        \ actors are not the only chief architects of the Africa\u201Fs lingering\
        \ conflicts and state failures, but also their local actors in the post-colonial\
        \ age are partially responsible for the political and economic troubles, and\
        \ the frequent state collapse. Somalia, for example, became a victim of internal\
        \ and external actors; while the post-state collapse actors are the tragic,\
        \ violent outcome of gradually deteriorating political dynamics since 1991.\
        \ From the rubble and ruins of the state, self-appointed warlords who struggled\
        \ to rule the country from the barrels of guns, business groups and, later,\
        \ Islamists aspire to power with the influence of external actors, both from\
        \ the region and beyond exacerbated the political instability and economic\
        \ shortcomings which impacted both on the state and the lives of the ordinary\
        \ Somali citizens.&#13;\nIn fact, numerous peacebuilding efforts and attempts\
        \ at building a centralized Somali national government have failed due to\
        \ extensive involvement of diverse external actors. Without exception, Somalia\
        \ neighbors, Arab and Western states have been involved in Somalia\u201Fs\
        \ conflict for political and economic reasons. This study, therefore, dismisses\
        \ that the external actors, both from the region and beyond will bring peace\
        \ and stability to Somalia. Therefore, the issue should be considered as a\
        \ Somali issue that has an economic, social, and political impact on the Somalis\
        \ at large, and according to this suggestion, any resolution to the Somalia\
        \ conflict needs indigenous efforts since it affects the internal peace and\
        \ security of the Somali citizens as well as their destiny. Without a unified\
        \ grassroots involvement, it is difficult to foresee a sustainable peace and\
        \ stability in Somalia.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-10-22T08:21:34Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:subject>Civil war, Horn of Africa</dc:subject>\n<dc:description>South\
        \ Sudan, after more than two decades of civil war, got its independence in\
        \ July 2011. Even though South Sudan seceded from its mother state, its relation\
        \ with the north is yet to be resolved. Today, relations between Khartoum\
        \ and Juba are heavily influenced by the outstanding issues in the 2005 Comprehensive\
        \ Peace Agreement (CPA) which have created obstacles to progress in both the\
        \ Sudan and South Sudan. Important unresolved CPA issues include fair and\
        \ equitable oil revenue-sharing between Sudan and South Sudan, conflict in\
        \ South Kordofan and Blue Niles, and the status of Abyei. Hence, in order\
        \ to maintain peace and security in the region, normalizations of relations\
        \ between the two Sudan is of fundamental importance. The contention of this\
        \ thesis is that the South Sudan secession has several security implications\
        \ for the countries of the Horn of African region. Source of inspiration for\
        \ other would be states (those in demand of secession), an influx of refugees,\
        \ spillover nature of conflicts and renewed bilateral relations are among\
        \ the implications. Through data analysis of primary and secondary sources\

        \ Right  Monitoring  Capacity :In The Case of  African Peer review Mechanism</dc:title>\n\

        \ Lako</dc:contributor>\n<dc:subject>Human rights, Pre-colonial</dc:subject>\n\
        <dc:description>This thesis assesses the human rights monitoring capacity\
        \ of the AU and the role APRM can play in it. It argues that, in Africa, historical\
        \ evidence suggests a continuing pattern of human rights violations have continued\
        \ by unchecked dictatorial regime. It also seeks to demonstrate that for various\
        \ reasons, the AU has been weak in monitoring of human rights violations.\
        \ This attributes to two main reasons. One, the relative dignity and human\
        \ value enjoyed by African in pre-colonial era became negatively impacted\
        \ by colonialism as an aspect of foreign intervention in Africa. This impact\
        \ has remains with the African leaders. The leaders become ruling the continent\
        \ after colonialism has been characterized as dictators and military leaders\
        \ which apply similar system of their previous colonial masters in violating\
        \ human rights. None of the Heads of State and Government was freely and fairly\
        \ elected. It was virtually the same club of dictators who adopted the African\
        \ Human rights Charter in 1981.&#13;\nSecond, the African commission and the\
        \ court are often ineffective because they lack resources and political commitments\
        \ of member states for the protection of human rights. Even at the level of\
        \ the assembly of heads of state, the reports of the African Commission do\
        \ not receive adequate attention or consideration but are often simply adopted\
        \ without due regard to the issues raised. Hitherto, the African system of\
        \ human rights has evolved against the experience of colonialism, dictatorships,\
        \ the failure of administering justice, and reluctance. Africa is still facing\
        \ the long road to promotion and protection of human rights for all Africans.\
        \ Yet within this setting the APRM had anticipated as an opportunity to hold\
        \ African leaders accountable and conceived as it can add value to human rights\
        \ monitoring capacity of African commission. Hence, this assessment is done\
        \ in relation to the work that is being done by APRM and the challenges that\
        \ it has confronted over the years. In assessing the role of the APRM in human\
        \ rights monitoring, this study discharges the importance of peer review and\
        \ investigates the challenges facing it in the field of human rights.</dc:description>\n\

        \ rock shelter is a very rich archaeological site with one of the most&#13;\n\
        complete late Pleistocene cultural sequence in the Horn of Africa. Despite\
        \ the rich&#13;\ncultural sequence, the pre-history and historic period of\
        \ human and plant interaction and&#13;\necological history of this site are\
        \ poorly documented and reconstructed. The objective of&#13;\nthis study was\
        \ to reconstruct food systems of the ancient inhabitants of Mochena Borago&#13;\n\
        rock shelter in the Late Holocene period. Archaeobotanical investigation was\
        \ conducted&#13;\non a 27 soil sample bags of 2000 and 2001 French Field seasons\
        \ at the Laboratory of the&#13;\nARCCH (Authority for Research and Conservation\
        \ of Cultural Heritage).For the better&#13;\ninterpretation of the archaeaobotanical\
        \ materials and data, ethnoarcheological studies&#13;\nwere undertaken in\
        \ the five Kebeles of Sodo Zurea Woreda. Based on this, a total of 64&#13;\n\
        plant spices were documented and 112 seeds and fruit stones were identified\
        \ by the&#13;\nArchaeobotanical investigation which included Sapindaceae cf.\
        \ Deinbollia type (n=55),&#13;\nMyrtaceae cf. Syzigium guineense type (n=33),\
        \ Plectranthus edulis (n=9),&#13;\nEuphorbiaceae Croton sp. (n=7), Cordia\
        \ cf. africana (n=2), Ebenaceae cf. Diospyros&#13;\n(n=1), Olea europaea sub\
        \ sp. cuspidate (n=1) and the rest four were unidentified. The&#13;\nethnobotanical\
        \ documentation reveled that five plant types that were used as food,&#13;\n\
        medicine and raw materials to be similar with the plants recovered by Archaeobotanical&#13;\n\
        investigation. Among the identified botanical remains, Plectranthus edulis\
        \ which is an&#13;\nindigenous crop for the study area, Cordia cf.africana\
        \ and Olea europaea sub sp.&#13;\ncusipdata are reported for the first time\
        \ in archaeobotanical context in the whole region&#13;\nof Ethiopia.</dc:description>\n\

        <dc:description>This thesis conceives of an analysis of Early Stone Age collections\
        \ from Melka Kunture,&#13;\nparticularly at Garba IV levels C and D. They\
        \ were excavated between 1972 to 1985 and are&#13;\ntoday stored at the Authority\
        \ for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage. In spite of&#13;\nongoing\
        \ researches conducted at these localities, raw material influence on the\
        \ knapping process&#13;\nof the knappers and the technological features of\
        \ the previously nominated artifact traditions&#13;\ncalled \u201CDeveloped\
        \ Oldowan\u201D is poorly understood. Methodologies like typological&#13;\n\
        classification, measurement of the technological axis, width, depth and so\
        \ forth, identification of&#13;\nraw material, understanding of thickness\
        \ evennes along the technological line of artifacts were&#13;\nemployed to\
        \ address the problem. The production techniques were influenced by the type\
        \ of raw&#13;\nmaterial. Although large flake productions are not large in\
        \ number, their appearance is an&#13;\nessential indicator about the emergence\
        \ of the Acheulean. The low number of Large Cutting&#13;\nTools is determined\
        \ by the original size of the unworked material. On account of this, not only&#13;\n\
        frequency of Large Cutting Tools, but also understanding various technological\
        \ innovations of&#13;\nan artifact has been found to be important in characterizing\
        \ Early Acheulean site. Therefore, the&#13;\nartifact tradition called \u201C\
        Developed Oldowan\u201D was not understood to be independet&#13;\ntechnologicaly.\
        \ It, rather, bears an evidence of technological similarities with the Early&#13;\n\
        Acheulean.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-10-22T10:05:09Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2015-10-22T10:05:09Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ Livelihood for rural women in the case of Garagodo and Hembecho primary\
        \ agricultural cooperative attempted to analyse the contribution of primary\
        \ agricultural cooperative in enabling women to build sustainable livelihood\
        \ which is capable of coping with and recover from vulnerability.&#13;\nThe\
        \ main objective of the study was to assess the role of primary agricultural\
        \ cooperatives in enabling women to cope with stresses and shocks through\
        \ building sustainable livelihood. By using the sustainable livelihood framework\
        \ adopted from DFID (199), the study tried to illustrate how the cooperatives\
        \ as transforming structure enabled women to build sustainable livelihood\
        \ by accessing livelihood capitals.&#13;\nThe study employed approximating\
        \ longitudinal survey as research design. It also employed both quantitative\
        \ and qualitative methods of data collection and analysis. The quantitative\
        \ method of data collection employed survey method and the qualitative method\
        \ of data collection employed in-depth interview, FGD, and observation methods.\
        \ Using the methods, primary data was collected from sample members of the\
        \ cooperatives, centrally placed officials from marketing and cooperative\
        \ development offices and managerial bodies of the cooperative enterprises.\
        \ Simple random sampling technique was employed so as to select sample respondents\
        \ of the study.&#13;\nThe finding of the study has revealed that the cooperatives\
        \ provided women with various services including supply of agricultural inputs,\
        \ credit services, marketing of agricultural input and output. Access to these\
        \ services in turn enabled women to improve their productivity, augment their\
        \ income, and build livelihood assets which are capable of withstanding risks\
        \ and shocks. Despite these benefits it yielded to women, the cooperative\
        \ encountered various problems that hampered the potential benefit of women,\
        \ which calls for the due attention of concerned bodies.</dc:description>\n\
