        <dc:description>Tiruvoor G. Nagaraja</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The\
        \ goal of this review is to provide an overview of the process by which policy\
        \ is developed for complex animal diseases. There is no one size fits all\
        \ approach to policy. Policy making for a disease is complex, often a bit\
        \ disorderly, and like medicine not an exact science. The current mission\
        \ behind the United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health\
        \ Inspection Service, Veterinary Services (USDA, APHIS-VS) and its role in\
        \ the One Health partnership is to adequately contribute to the animal health\
        \ component. One Health is a crucial component behind the response to any\
        \ emerging disease because of the interrelatedness of animal, human, and environmental\
        \ health. The following document strives to further support the advancement\
        \ of the One Health concept as it relates to complex animal diseases. &#13;\n\
        &#13;\n\tThis review also illustrates just what can happen when a student\
        \ becomes an integrated part of One Health and public policy. Throughout the\
        \ development of this paper, I found myself diving right into the very concepts\
        \ that I had previously only seen and heard in the classroom. This paper serves\
        \ not only as an APHIS training document, but as substantial evidence of how\
        \ a field experience can turn an array of concepts into a workable puzzle\
        \ by which one builds a career dedicated to One Health.</dc:description>\n\

        \ A. Montelone</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The safety, health and well-being\
        \ of animals are critical to the safety, health and well-being of humans.\
        \  Public health emergencies can range from unpredictable and uncontrollable\
        \ natural disasters, to man-made bioterrorism threats.  Public health emergencies\
        \ also include livestock disease outbreaks resulting in the loss of large\
        \ numbers of livestock and agricultural products, a decrease in food quality\
        \ and security and potentially result in devastating human health consequences.\
        \  For these reasons, it is important to implement an Agricultural Emergency\
        \ Response Corps to limit the detrimental effects to both humans and animals\
        \ that can potentially occur from these emergencies, particularly those involving\
        \ the emergence of a foreign animal disease (FAD).  &#13;\nCurrently, there\
        \ are many active state animal emergency response teams across the country.\
        \  They are strictly volunteer-based and focus almost solely on veterinary\
        \ participation.  This project is the foundation for development of a well-rounded\
        \ team of individuals who will be trained to respond quickly and efficiently\
        \ to an emergency.  The goal of the Kansas Agricultural Emergency Response\
        \ Corps (KAERC) is to create an all-encompassing unit with a wide range of\
        \ expertise to cover all the facets of a public health emergency relating\
        \ to animals, as well as overall human health.  &#13;\nThe final product is\
        \ a draft of a white paper to be submitted for government approval along with\
        \ a tentative list of detailed position descriptions and roles that would\
        \ best benefit the initial framework of the corps.  The KAERC will fall under\
        \ the Kansas Department of Agriculture.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2016-01-19T22:38:10Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>The author carried out his field experience in the Kansas\
        \ Department of Agriculture, Division of Animal Health in Manhattan, Kansas\
        \ from August 2014 to May 2015.  The Kansas Department of Agriculture is the\
        \ oldest agriculture department in the United States. It has as its responsibility,\
        \ the overall support of agriculture in Kansas. The Kansas Department of Agriculture\
        \ (KDA) is divided into a number of divisions and programs to carry out its\
        \ mission. The Division of Animal Health was created in 1969 from a consolidation\
        \ of the Livestock Sanitary Commission and the State Brand Commission. The\
        \ Division of Animal Health joined the Kansas Department of Agriculture in\
        \ 2011. It is comprised of three programs: animal disease control, livestock\
        \ brands and animal facilities inspection. The Kansas Board of Veterinary\
        \ Examiners also operates under the Division of Animal Health. The Division\
        \ of Animal Health\u2019s objectives include the securing of public health\
        \ and safety of the citizens of Kansas through the prevention, control and\
        \ eradication of infectious diseases and conditions affecting the health of\
        \ livestock and domestic animals in the state. &#13;\n&#13;\nThe author was\
        \ involved in several different projects and activities. These included: &#13;\n\
        &#13;\n1)\tBiosecurity recommendations for the Kansas State Fair&#13;\n&#13;\n\
        2)\tEbola virus disease table top exercises for state agencies in Kansas,&#13;\n\
        &#13;\n3)\tForeign animal disease (FAD) outbreak: Foot and Mouth Disease table-top\
        \      exercises&#13;\n&#13;\n4)\tLow pathogenic avian influenza outbreak\
        \ table-top exercise &#13;\n&#13;\n5)\tOne Health Collaboration Gap Analysis.\
        \ &#13;\n&#13;\nThe author completed a lengthy project (culminating experience)\
        \ in the development of biosecurity recommendations for the Kansas State Fair.\
        \ These recommendations dealt with several facets of biosecurity including\
        \ animal-to-human disease prevention (zoonotic diseases) as well as animal-to-animal\
        \ disease prevention. The challenge of having large numbers of people at the\
        \ fair in crowded spaces, combined with thousands of head of livestock and\
        \ poultry while at the same time encouraging people to consume food and drink,\
        \ sets up the potential for large outbreaks of zoonotic and/or food borne\
        \ diseases.  In preparing these recommendations, several factors weigh heavily\
        \ into making practical, science based recommendations to protect the public.\
        \ These factors include, the positive name of Kansas agriculture (which is\
        \ show-cased at the fair), aging fair facilities and limited financial budgets.\
        \ Human behavior also plays a large roll in reducing or increasing the risks\
        \ of zoonotic disease at the fair or petting zoo. Education of fair visitors\
        \ is vital to raising awareness that apparently healthy animals can be a source\
        \ of disease. Facilities for hand washing or hand sanitizing along with promoting\
        \ the use of these hand hygiene techniques is necessary to reduce the occurrence\
        \ of zoonotic disease at the fair. &#13;\nThe biosecurity documents were constructed\
        \ as three different levels of biosecurity: gold (highest), silver (medium)\
        \ and bronze (lowest level). The intention was that the Kansas State Fair\
        \ management not be overwhelmed at the prospect of trying to achieve too many\
        \ changes in a single year of operation. The gold level may not be financially\
        \ possible the first or second year of improvement and the management could\
        \ opt for attempting a lower level as opposed to making no biosecurity improvements.\
        \ These three separate documents appear in their entirety in the Appendix\
        \ section of this report.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2016-01-19T22:38:41Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>In the United States (US) 133 billion pounds of food was wasted\
        \ at the consumer and retail level in 2010, resulting in a total loss of 161.6\
        \ billion dollars (Buzby, Wells, &amp; Hyman, 2014).  This translates into\
        \ 387 billion calories per day being wasted, of which 96% ends up in landfills\
        \ (Buzby et al., 2014).  Moreover, decomposing food waste in landfills emits\
        \ methane, a potent greenhouse gas, that accounts for 20% of all methane emissions\
        \ (EPA, 2014).&#13;\n\tFood waste can come from a variety of sources, including\
        \ at the farm level (e.g., food lost to a unfavorable environment conditions),\
        \ the farm to retail level (e.g., foods that do not meet food safety regulations;\
        \ are misshapen or blemished), the retail level (e.g., dented cans; damaged\
        \ packaging), and the consumer level (e.g., plate waste; food that spoils\
        \ before consumption) (Buzby et al., 2014).  In 2013 the United States Department\
        \ of Agriculture (USDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched\
        \ the U.S Food Waste Challenge in an attempt to reduce, recover, and recycle\
        \ food waste in the United States (USDA OCE, n.d.).  One of the major commitments\

        \ reactors (MCRs) have been evaluated for the selective hydro-treating of\
        \ model reactions; the partial hydrogenation of soybean oil (PHSO), and the\
        \ conversion of lactic acid into commodity chemicals.   Membranes were rendered\
        \ catalytically active by depositing metal catalyst onto the polymer \"skin\"\
        \ of an asymmetric membrane.  Hydrogen was supplied to the support side of\
        \ the membrane and permeated from the support side to the skin side, where\
        \ it adsorbed directly onto the metal surface.  Liquid reactant was circulated\
        \ over the membrane, allowing the liquid to come into direct contact with\
        \ the metal coated surface of the membrane, where the reaction occurred. \
        \ Our membrane contact reactor approach replaces traditional three-phase batch\
        \ slurry reactors.  These traditional reactors possess inherent mass transfer\
        \ limitations due to low hydrogen solubility in liquid and slow diffusion\
        \ to the catalyst surface. This causes hydrogen starvation at the catalyst\
        \ surface, resulting in undesirable side reactions and/or extreme operating\
        \ pressures of 100 atmospheres or more.  By using membrane reactors, we were\
        \ able to rapidly supply hydrogen to the catalyst surface.    &#13;\nWhen\
        \ the PHSO is performed in a traditional slurry reactor, the aforementioned\
        \ hydrogen starvation leads to a high amounts of trans-fats.  Using a MCR,\
        \ we were able to reduce trans-fats by over 50% for equal levels of hydrogenation.\
        \  It was further demonstrated that an increase in temperature had minimal\
        \ effects on trans-fat formation, while significantly increasing hydrogenation\
        \ rates; allowing the system to capture higher reaction rates without adversely\
        \ affecting product quality.  Additionally, high temperatures favors the hydrogenation\
        \ of polyenes over monoenes, leading to low amounts of saturated fats.  MCRs\
        \ were shown to operator at high temperatures and: (1) capture high reaction\
        \ rates, (2) minimize saturated fats, and (3) minimize trans-fats. &#13;\n\
        We also demonstrated lactic acid conversion into commodity chemicals using\
        \ MCRs.  Our results show that all MCR experiments had faster reaction rate\
        \ than all of our controls, indicating that MCRs have high levels of hydrogen\
        \ coverage at the catalyst.  It was also demonstrated that changing reaction\
        \ conditions (pressure and temperature) changed the product selectivities;\
        \ giving the potential for MCRs to manipulate product selectivity.</dc:description>\n\

        \ chert reservoirs, also known as chat reservoirs among the mid-continent\
        \ in Kansas and northern Oklahoma, produce an abundant amount of hydrocarbons.\
        \ Since the 1920s, chat reservoirs in Kansas have yielded over 380 million\
        \ bbl of oil and 2.3 tcf of natural gas. The largest Mississippian field in\
        \ south-central Kansas is the Spivey-Grabs, which spans Kingman and Harper\
        \ Counties. Development of the Spivey-Grabs Mississippian reservoir, and continued\
        \ production within the field, has been compromised by compartmentalization\
        \ within the field, resulting in unpredictable producing rates. Previous research\
        \ has investigated the differences of the fluids within the separate compartments\
        \ (Evans, 2011; Kwasny, 2015), and identified the existence of at least two\
        \ oil types of differing viscosity (Kwasny, 2015). The objective of this research\
        \ was to determine whether the compartmentalization of the reservoir is controlled\
        \ by the different lithologic characteristics between the various compartments.\
        \ This was accomplished by examining drill cuttings under binocular microscope,\
        \ under a petrographic microscope using digital imaging software, and under\
        \ the high magnification of a scanning electron microscope.&#13;\nCalculated\
        \ rock porosity from ImageJ software showed variation among the wells selected\
        \ for this study; but the porosity variation does not correlate with differences\
        \ in fluid viscosity that was previously observed, i.e. heavy and light viscosity\
        \ oils (Kwasny, 2015). Heavy oils were seen in wells that had both higher\
        \ and lower porosity values, and the same is true for the distribution of\
        \ light oils. This suggested that fluid viscosity is the major controlling\
        \ factor in compartmentalization in the Spivey-Grabs and not rock properties.</dc:description>\n\

        <dc:description>Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have become a vehicle to\
        \ deliver products and services internationally. It is a favored strategy\
        \ widely adopted for implementing complex urban developments in the United\
        \ States. However, the complex nature of such partnerships raises serious\
        \ concerns about meaningful community engagement. Meaningful community engagement\
        \ is a result of the presence and quality of transparency and public participation\
        \ elements that are strongly correlated. &#13;\n The following research describes\
        \ how the community was involved and contributed to an urban development PPP\
        \ project in Manhattan, Kansas. The research goal is to understand the mechanism\
        \ of the community engagement in a PPP project and to evaluate the quality\
        \ of the process at the local level from a planning perspective. With an in-depth\
        \ case study and an understanding of meaningful community engagement processes,\
        \ this research will contribute to the body of knowledge in the area of PPPs\
        \ and meaningful community engagement at the local level and evaluate local\
        \ PPP policies and practices.&#13;\n The first objective is to evaluate the\
        \ participation opportunities with a developed Community Engagement Attribute\
        \ Evaluation System (CEAES) based on the recognized metrics of quality practices.\
        \ Attributes are drawn from the identified characteristics of quality transparency\
        \ and quality public participation of meaningful practices. The second goal\
        \ is to interview the key stakeholders of the project from the public sector,\
        \ the private sector, and the community and add depth to the findings that\
        \ complements the overall evaluation. &#13;\n Through both technical evaluation\
        \ and open-ended personal interview, this study attempts to describe the design\
        \ and the process of public participation practices. Analysis will show whether\
        \ or not the community was meaningfully engaged and if the technical aspects\
        \ of a quality community engagement practice were present. Finally, this study\
        \ aims to inform future similar planning practices. The result serves two\
        \ local purposes of planning governance and policy. For the former, it will\
        \ help those with no record of PPP to better design and implement the engagement\
        \ process; and for the ones with PPPs\u2019 experience, it will contribute\
        \ to the quality of the future partnerships. For the latter, it will guide\
        \ the local governments and policy makers to better address PPPs\u2019 ongoing\
        \ issue of community engagement.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-12-14T20:54:14Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ watershed projects have been responsible for reducing floodwater damage\
        \ across the state since the formation of watershed districts, following the\
        \ Kansas Watershed District Act of 1953. A total of 80 organized watershed\
        \ districts now take on the responsibilities associated with watershed management\
        \ and protecting the land uses within them. Today, Kansas watershed districts\
        \ face challenges in completing nearly half of the 3,000 structures proposed\
        \ since 1953. Insufficient funding, burdensome policy changes, and a declining\
        \ interest from local board members and landowners are key challenges boards\
        \ must overcome in addition to managing rapidly aging infrastructure and dealing\
        \ with projects that have exceeded their life expectancy.&#13;\nResearch methods\
        \ used for this report include content analysis of general work plans, relevant\
        \ federal and state policies, and interviews with local stakeholders. In order\
        \ to understand the economic, political, social and geographic impacts of\
        \ watershed development, the following issues are addressed: cost-benefit\
        \ ratios using monetary and non-monetary benefits, differences between federal\
        \ and state funding in regards to rehabilitation and best management practices,\
        \ local perceptions of watershed development, and spatial factors that exist\
        \ among watershed districts. This study found that watershed projects have\
        \ the potential to provide up to $115 million each year in monetary and flood\
        \ damage reduction benefits in Kansas protecting over 35,000 miles of transportation\
        \ routes while providing recreation opportunities and enhancing environmental\
        \ conservation efforts. Political and social impacts were identified through\
        \ in-person interviews with 21 local stakeholders that include landowners,\
        \ board members and state representatives, representing 21 different watershed\
        \ districts. Perceptions of political and social issues indicate that when\
        \ government assistance is available, watershed districts are more willing\
        \ to deal with increased regulations. However, a lack of financial support\
        \ that has existed in Kansas watershed districts over the last eight years\

        <dc:description>Organic-rich shales were deposited over a large part of what\
        \ is now North America during the Late Devonian. North America in the late\
        \ Devonian was located in the tropics (Woodrow et al., 1973), possibly in\
        \ low southerly latitudes (Heckel and Witzke, 1979; Witzke and Heckel, 1988;\
        \ Streel et al., 1990). This environment creates an organic-rich environment\
        \ that resulted in thick, black shales. The Devonian-Mississippian Chattanooga\
        \ (Woodford) shale is known to be an important petroleum source rock in many\
        \ intracratonic basins of the Midcontinent (Lambert, 1993).&#13;\nGeochemical\
        \ analysis of the Chattanooga shale, using various techniques, provides additional\
        \ information on oil-source rock potential. Handheld XRF analysis was conducted\
        \ on well cuttings samples, Loss on Ignition (LOI) was performed on a subset\
        \ of those samples and mapping of the organic matter results of the two methods\
        \ was completed.&#13;\nHandheld XRF still has the prospect for providing quick\
        \ analysis to infer organic matter content to be used as a determination of\
        \ the quality of source rock. Although slightly reduced correlation has been\
        \ found within this study compared to Willey (2015), the method has still\
        \ proven viable for fracking targets to be determined on site and in a more\
        \ efficient manner. Loss on Ignition results have correlated with TOC data\
        \ better then XRF results, making this method the better option for evaluating\
        \ source rock potential. Mapping of these results provide the first known\
        \ source rock potential map across Kansas and can be used by the industry\
        \ for future exploration.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-12-16T20:34:49Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ foods and consumer awareness have indirectly increased the demand for novel\
        \ and naturally occurring compounds that can delay oxidative deterioration\
        \ and maintain nutritional quality of foods. Natural antioxidants from certain\
        \ herbs and spices such as rosmarinic acid from rosemary, thymol from oregano,\
        \ eugenol from clove, curcumin from turmeric are rich in polyphenolic compounds\
        \ that provide long term oxidative stability as well as offer additional health\
        \ benefits. High antioxidative capacity of herbs and spices phenolics could\
        \ potentially substitute synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene\
        \ (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate (PG), octyl gallate,\
        \ and tert-butylated hydroquinone (TBHQ) in the food system. Synthetic antioxidants\
        \ such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)\
        \ are thermally unstable and decompose at higher temperatures. However, widely\
        \ used cooking methods such as baking, frying, boiling, and roasting use high\
        \ thermal temperature that can chemically degrade herbs and spices and diminish\
        \ their antioxidative capacity, but they have been little studied. In this\
        \ context, this review deals with the need of natural antioxidants, spices\
        \ and herbs as natural antioxidants, their origin, chemical composition, pharmacological,\
        \ and antioxidant properties. Moreover, the impact of temperature on total\
        \ antioxidant capacity (TAC) of various herbs and spices such as cinnamon,\
        \ clove, nutmeg, mace, oregano, rosemary, sage, and turmeric is highlighted.\
        \ Different antioxidant assays are also studied and this approach revealed\
        \ that there is a clear correlation between total phenolic content (TPC) and\
        \ TAC of herbs and spices and specific phenolic compounds are responsible\
        \ for the antioxidative capacity of particular herb and spice. These findings\
        \ identified the optimum cooking temperature-time combination which results\
        \ in the highest retention of antioxidative capacity and assures higher quality\
        \ of food for the maintenance of human health.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-12-16T20:38:03Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>Matthew W. Totten</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The thermal\
        \ maturity of hydrocarbon-rich source rocks can be estimated by several different\
        \ methods. These methods focus on a specific geochemical or mineralogical\
        \ aspect contained within the rock. Because each method has limitations, it\
        \ is advisable to use several methods to better determine thermal maturation.\
        \ This report summarizes two common methods used to determine thermal maturity,\
        \ vitrinite reflectance and illitization. Vitrinite reflectance and illitization\
        \ have both been shown to be effected by similar temperatures that are within\
        \ the hydrocarbon generation window. In some previous studies these two methods\
        \ give different levels of maturation when looked at in tandem. Formations\
        \ such as the Woodford Shale of Oklahoma are made up almost completely of\
        \ illite in the clay fraction, even at low levels of vitrinite reflectance.\
        \ These are also without a clear source of potassium, which is often the limiting\
        \ factor in the process of illitization. Totten et al. (2013) suggest that\
        \ in place of potassium feldspars, which are a common source of K\u207A for\
        \ illite (but lacking in the Woodford) that the needed K\u207A was provided\
        \ by the organic material that was being altered under the same temperatures\
        \ of the clay minerals. The Woodford contains large amounts of organic matter,\
        \ This would be consistent with promoting illitization at lower thermal maturities\
        \ than organic-poor shales.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-12-17T21:10:14Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>The unique contribution of Vision and the Experience of Built\
        \ Environments is its specific investigation into the visual processing system\
        \ of the mind in relationship with the features of awareness and embodiment\
        \ during the experience of architecture.  Each facet of this investigation\
        \ reflects the essential ingredients of sensation (the visual system), perception\
        \ (our awareness), and emotions (our embodiment) respectively as a process\
        \ for aesthetically experiencing our built environments.  In regards to our\
        \ visual system, it is well established in neuroscience that human vision\
        \ divides into the central and peripheral fields of view.  Central vision\
        \ extends from the point of gaze (where we are looking) out to about 5\xB0\
        \ of visual angle (the width of one\u2019s fist at arm\u2019s length), while\
        \ peripheral vision is the vast remainder of the visual field.  These visual\
        \ fields project to the parvo and magno ganglion cells which process distinctly\
        \ different types of information from the world around us and project that\
        \ information to the ventral and dorsal visual streams respectively.  Building\
        \ on the dorsal/ventral stream dichotomy, we can further distinguish between\
        \ focal processing of central vision and ambient processing of peripheral\
        \ vision.  Thus, our visual processing of, and attention to, objects and scenes\
        \ depends on how and where these stimuli fall on the retina.  Built environments\
        \ are no exception to these dependencies, specifically in terms of how focal\
        \ object perception and ambient spatial perception create intellectual and\
        \ phenomenal experiences respectively with architecture.  These two forms\
        \ of visual processing limit and guide our perception of the built world around\
        \ us and subsequently our projected and extended embodied interactions with\
        \ it as manifested in the act of aesthetic experience.  By bringing peripheral\
        \ vision and central vision together in a balanced perspective we will more\
        \ fully understand that our aesthetic relationship with our built environment\
        \ is greatly dependent on the dichotomous visual mechanisms of awareness and\
        \ embodiment.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2015-12-17T16:50:05Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based sentiment learning into HDP. This model\
        \ preserves the benefits of nonparametric Bayesian models for topic learning,\

        \ HDP framework for learning topics from free text with latent authorship\
        \ learning within a generative model using author list information. This model\
        \ adds one more layer into the current hierarchy of HDPs to represent topic\
        \ groups shared by authors, and the document topic distribution is represented\
        \ as a mixture of topic distribution of its authors. This model automatically\
        \ learns author contribution partitions for documents in addition to topics.</dc:description>\n\

        <dc:description>Background: Sucralfate impairs absorption of ciprofloxacin\
        \ and other fluoroquinolones in humans, but no sucralfate-fluoroquinolone\
        \ interaction has been reported in dogs. Veterinary formularies recommend\
        \ avoiding concurrent administration of these medications, which might impact\
        \ compliance, therapeutic success, and resistance selection from fluoroquinolones.\
        \ Objectives: To determine whether a drug interaction exists when sucralfate\
        \ is administered to fed dogs concurrently with ciprofloxacin or enrofloxacin,\
        \ and whether a 2 hour delay between fluoroquinolone and sucralfate affects\
        \ fluoroquinolone absorption. Animals: Five healthy Greyhounds housed in a\
        \ research colony. Methods: This was a randomized crossover study. Treatments\
        \ included oral ciprofloxacin (C) or oral enrofloxacin (E) alone, each fluoroquinolone\
        \ concurrently with an oral suspension of sucralfate (CS, ES), and sucralfate\
        \ suspension 2 hours after each fluoroquinolone (C2S, E2S). Fluoroquinolone\
        \ concentrations were evaluated using liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry.\
        \ Results: Drug exposure of ciprofloxacin was highly variable (AUC 5.52-22.47\
        \ h ?g/mL) compared to enrofloxacin (AUC 3.86-7.50 h ?g/mL). The mean relative\
        \ bioavailability for ciprofloxacin and concurrent sucralfate was 48% (range\
        \ 8-143%) compared to ciprofloxacin alone. Relative bioavailability of ciprofloxacin\
        \ improved to 87% (range 37-333%) when sucralfate was delayed by 2 hours.\
        \ By contrast, relative bioavailability for enrofloxacin and concurrent sucralfate\
        \ was 104% (94-115%).</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Citation: KuKanich,\

        <dc:description>What is the relationship between film viewers' eye movements\
        \ and their film comprehension? Typical Hollywood movies induce strong attentional\
        \ synchrony\u2014most viewers look at the same things at the same time. Thus,\
        \ we asked whether film viewers' eye movements would differ based on their\
        \ understanding\u2014the\_mental model\_hypothesis\u2014or whether any such\
        \ differences would be overwhelmed by viewers' attentional synchrony\u2014\
        the\_tyranny of filmhypothesis. To investigate this question, we manipulated\
        \ the presence/absence of prior film context and measured resulting differences\
        \ in film comprehension and eye movements. Viewers watched a 12-second James\
        \ Bond movie clip, ending just as a critical predictive inference should be\
        \ drawn that Bond's nemesis,</dc:description>\n<dc:description>would fall\
        \ from the sky onto a circus tent. The No-context condition saw only the 12-second\
        \ clip, but the Context condition also saw the preceding 2.5 minutes of the\
        \ movie before seeing the critical 12-second portion. Importantly, the Context\
        \ condition viewers were more likely to draw the critical inference and were\
        \ more likely to perceive coherence across the entire 6 shot sequence (as\
        \ shown by event segmentation), indicating greater comprehension. Viewers'\
        \ eye movements showed strong attentional synchrony in both conditions as\
        \ compared to a chance level baseline, but smaller differences between conditions.\
        \ Specifically, the Context condition viewers showed slightly, but significantly,\
        \ greater attentional synchrony and lower cognitive load (as shown by fixation\
        \ probability) during the critical first circus tent shot. Thus, overall,\
        \ the results were more consistent with the tyranny of film hypothesis than\
        \ the mental model hypothesis. These results suggest the need for a theory\
        \ that encompasses processes from the perception to the comprehension of film.</dc:description>\n\

        \ significantly to subsurface energy resources by converting organic matter\
        \ in hydrocarbon reservoirs into methane, the main component of natural gas.\
        \ In this study, we consider environmental controls on microbial populations\
        \ in coal-bearing strata of the Cherokee basin, an unconventional natural\
        \ gas resource in southeast Kansas, USA. Pennsylvanian-age strata in the basin\
        \ contain numerous thin (0.4-1.1 m) coalbeds with marginal thermal maturities\
        \ (0.5-0.7% Ro) that are interbedded with shale and sandstone. We collected\
        \ gas, water, and microbe samples from 16 commercial coalbed methane wells\
        \ for geochemical and microbiological analysis. The water samples were Na-Cl\
        \ type with total dissolved solids (TDS) content ranging from 34.9 to 91.3\
        \ g L?1. Gas dryness values [C1/(C2 + C3)] averaged 2640 and carbon and hydrogen\
        \ isotope ratios of methane differed from those of carbon dioxide and water,\
        \ respectively, by an average of 65 and 183%. These values are thought to\
        \ be consistent with gas that formed primarily by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis.\
        \ Results from cultivation assays and taxonomic analysis of 16S rRNA genes\
        \ agree with the geochemical results. Cultivable methanogens were present\
        \ in every sample tested, methanogen sequences dominate the archaeal community\
        \ in each sample (avg 91%), and few archaeal sequences (avg 4.2%) were classified\
        \ within Methanosarcinales, an order of methanogens known to contain methylotrophic\
        \ methanogens. Although hydrogenotrophs appear dominant, geochemical and microbial\
        \ analyses both indicate that the proportion of methane generated by acetoclastic\
        \ methanogens increases with the solute content of formation water, a trend\
        \ that is contrary to existing conceptual models. Consistent with this trend,\
        \ beta diversity analyses show that archaeal diversity significantly correlates\
        \ with formation water solute content. In contrast, bacterial diversity more\
        \ strongly correlates with location than solute content, possibly as a result\
        \ of spatial variation in the thermal maturity of the coalbeds.</dc:description>\n\
