<td colspan="2" class="bigdent">
<p>Filtering surgery adequately lowers intraocular pressure in most glaucoma patients. &nbsp;However, the prognosis is less favorable for aphakic patients with glaucoma or glaucoma in phakic eyes following unsuccessful filtering operations. &nbsp;Failure of filtering surgery is usually attributed to the proliferation of fibroblasts at the filtering site. The use of 5-FU, an antimetabolite, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of fibroblasts in tissue culture, and in preliminary studies it has increased the success of filtering surgery in a nonhuman primate model.<br>
<br>The Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study (FFSS) was a randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing the success rate of standard glaucoma filtering surgery to the success rate of standard surgery with adjunctive 5-FU treatment.<br>
<br>Another element of this study was to evaluate the frequency and severity of possible adverse effects related to 5-FU injections. &nbsp;Detailed preoperative and postoperative examinations of the cornea, lens, and retina were performed. &nbsp;Systemic toxicity was assessed by preoperative and postoperative hematologic studies.<br>
<br>After the investigators performed the filtering surgery and determined that the new outlet channel was working, patients were randomized to receive either 5-FU injections or standard postsurgical care without 5-FU. The patients treated with 5-FU received subconjunctival injections of 5 mg of 5-FU twice daily on postoperative days 1 through 7 and once daily on postoperative days 8 through 14. &nbsp;There were 213 patients recruited into the study, 162 with previous cataract extraction and 51 with previous filtering surgery.<br>
<br>All patients were examined at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 18 months, and 2 years postoperatively and at yearly intervals thereafter until 5 years postoperatively. &nbsp;Possible concomitant risks of 5-FU treatment, such as toxic effects to the cornea, lens, or retina, were monitored.</p>
