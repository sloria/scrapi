<td colspan="2" class="bigdent">
<p>The primary objective is to determine if BPL's GAMMAPLEX raises the platelet count of subjects with chronic ITP to a threshold of 50 x 109/L, similar to that of a historical control. &nbsp;The secondary objectives are: &nbsp;1) to determine the safety of GAMMAPLEX at the dosage used in this study. &nbsp;2) to determine if GAMMAPLEX maintains platelet counts of &sup3; 50 x 109/L in subjects with chronic ITP for a period of time similar to that of a historical control.</p>

<p>The first course of GAMMAPLEX will be administered as an intravenous infusion of 1 g/kg on each of 2 consecutive days. &nbsp;If required, a further 1 or 2 courses on the same dosage regimen may be administered in the period Day 32 to Day 90 following the first course of GAMMAPLEX.</p>
