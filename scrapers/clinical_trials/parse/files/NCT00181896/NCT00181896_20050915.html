<th>Detailed description</th>

<td colspan="2" class="bigdent">
<p>While anti-manic agents can effectively control manic symptoms, bipolar patients frequently continue to struggle with residual depressive symptomatology that can be associated with severe morbidity and suicidality. &nbsp;Because antidepressants can activate manic symptoms in bipolar patients with depression, the treatment of bipolar depression poses unique and challenging therapeutic dilemmas Thus, the identification of appropriate safe and effective treatment strategies for the management of depression in bipolar youth is particularly taxing considering that pediatric mania is predominantly mixed with a strong depressive component. A recent study in our program of bupropion SR in 30 adults with ADHD and Bipolar disorder, treatment with bupropion SR was extremely well tolerated and was not associated with activation of manic symptoms. Because bupropion has not been evaluated in the treatment of bipolar depression in youth, there is a pressing need to evaluate its effectiveness and safety in the context of a treatment protocol aimed at carefully evaluating this issue.<br>
