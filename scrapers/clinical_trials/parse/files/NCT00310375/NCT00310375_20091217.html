<td colspan="2" class="bigdent">
<p>This Phase 3 trial is an open-label extension study of the placebo-controlled, double-blind VRX-RET-E22-301 trial. &nbsp;Patients who have completed the VRX-RET-E22-301 trial and who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be treated with 600-1200 mg/day of retigabine as an adjunct therapy to their current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or vagal nerve stimulation. &nbsp;Treatment will be continued until retigabine is commercially available, or until the program is discontinued. &nbsp;Patients will be recruited from 45-50 sites in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. &nbsp;The safety and tolerability of long-term therapy with retigabine administered as adjunctive therapy in adult epilepsy patients with partial-onset seizures will be evaluated. &nbsp;In addition, the efficacy of long-term treatment with retigabine and patient quality of life will be assessed.</p>
