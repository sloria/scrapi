<td colspan="2" class="bigdent">
<p>Purpose and Objective:<br>1. &nbsp;To compare the effects of either an abbreviated or protracted taper of dexamethasone on functional capacity in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients.<br>2. &nbsp;To compare neurocognitive function in newly diagnosed GBM patients receiving either an abbreviated or protracted taper of dexamethasone.<br>3. &nbsp;To compare skeletal muscle strength in newly diagnosed GBM patients receiving either an abbreviated or protracted taper of dexamethasone.<br>4. &nbsp;To examine the association between functional capacity and neurocognitive function and patient-reported measures (i.e. quality of life, fatigue, etc.) in newly diagnosed GBM patient on either an abbreviated or protracted taper of dexamethasone.<br>5. To examine the association between functional capacity and neurocognitive function and body composition measures (body-mass index, etc.) in newly diagnosed GBM patient on either an abbreviated or protracted taper of dexamethasone.<br>6. To examine the association between functional capacity and neurocognitive function and biochemical metabolic measurements in newly diagnosed GBM patient on either an abbreviated or protracted taper of dexamethasone.<br>
<br>
<br>All study endpoints will be assessed at three timepoints as follows: (1) initial assessment after surgery in the hospital, (2) second assessment at initial clinical visit at the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center (PRT-BTC) at Duke, approximately 1 week post-operatively, and (3) third assessment at second clinical visit in the PRT-BTC at Duke, approximately 10 weeks post-operatively and after completion of radiotherapy. &nbsp;An additional fourth assessment will be obtained at 4 weeks post-operatively if the subject is undergoing radiotherapy here at Duke.</p>
