<td colspan="2" class="bigdent">
<p>This study is a multinational, European, multicenter, randomized, open-label, active comparator controlled study with two study periods: &nbsp;a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, and an open-label treatment phase of 18 months.<br>Approximately 100 adult men with osteoporosis associated with sustained glucocorticoid therapy will be enrolled into the study. &nbsp;Approximately one half of the patients (at all investigational sites) will be randomized to teriparatide 20 micrograms/day (given as a subcutaneous injection), and the other half randomized to risedronate 35 mg once weekly oral tablet. &nbsp;All patients will receive approximately 1000 mg/day elemental calcium and 800 to 1200 IU/day of vitamin D.</p>

<tr>
<td colspan="2" class="bigdent">
<p>Inclusion Criteria:<br>
<br>- Ambulatory men 25 years of age and older presenting to Visit 1 with a BMD of at least 1.5 SD below the corresponding normal young adult men average BMD (T score of -1.5 or lower), as determined from the manufacturer's database at any of the following regions of interest: &nbsp;total hip, femoral neck, or lumbar spine<br>
<br>- Have received glucocorticoid therapy at an average dose of at least 5.0 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent for a minimum of 3 consecutive months immediately preceding screening (Visit 1), as determined by medical history.<br>
<br>- A minimum of 2 lumbar vertebrae in the L-1 through L-3 region must be evaluable by quantitative computerized tomography.<br>
<br>- Normal or clinically insignificant abnormal laboratory values (as determined by the investigator) including serum calcium, PTH(1 84), and 25 hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, and alkaline phosphatase activity.<br>
<br>
<br>Exclusion Criteria:<br>
<br> &nbsp;- Presence of a mild, moderate or severe spinal fracture in both T-12 and L-1, as determined by the central reading facility using the semiquantitative technique.<br>
<br>- Abnormal albumin-corrected serum calcium levels<br>
<br>- History of unresolved skeletal diseases that affect bone metabolism other than glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis<br>
<br>- History of malignant neoplasms in the 5 years prior to Visit 2, with the exception of superficial basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin that have been definitively treated. Increased baseline risk of osteosarcoma; this includes patients with Paget's disease of the bone, previous primary skeletal malignancy, or skeletal exposure to therapeutic irradiation.<br>
<br>- Abnormal thyroid function not corrected by therapy<br>
<br>- Past and/or current treatment with certain medications.</p>
