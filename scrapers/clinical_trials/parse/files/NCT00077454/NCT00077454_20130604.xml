<textblock>
This  phase  I  trial  is  studying  the  side  effects  and  best  dose  of  erlotinib  when  given  with  temozolomide  in  treating  young  patients  with  recurrent  or  refractory  solid  tumors.  Erlotinib  may  stop  the  growth  of  tumor  cells  by  blocking  the  enzymes  necessary  for  their  growth.  Drugs  used  in  chemotherapy,  such  as  temozolomide,  work  in  different  ways  to  stop  tumor  cells  from  dividing  so  they  stop  growing  or  die.  Giving  erlotinib  with  temozolomide  may  kill  more  tumor  cells.

  PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:
  I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.
  II. Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this drug alone and with temozolomide in these patients.
  III. Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.
  IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.
 
  SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:
  I. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.
 
  OUTLINE: This is a 2-part, multicenter, dose-escalation study of erlotinib. Patients are stratified according to pretreatment (heavily pretreated [received more than 2 prior multiagent myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens OR received prior craniospinal or pelvic radiotherapy or bone marrow transplantation OR has bone marrow involvement] vs less heavily pretreated).Part 1: 
 
  Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-28. Beginning with course 2, patients also receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 23 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
 
  Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib during course 1 only until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
 
  Part 2: Patients receive erlotinib (at the MTD) and temozolomide as in part 1. 
 
  PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-45 patients (9-24 for part 1 and up to 21 for part 2) will be accrued for this study.
