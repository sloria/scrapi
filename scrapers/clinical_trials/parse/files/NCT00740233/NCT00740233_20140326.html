<td colspan="2" class="bigdent">
<p>PROCAIM, which stands for Patient-Reported Outcomes from Complementary, Alternative, and Integrative Medicine, was developed to collect and manage longitudinal patient data and implement patient-based outcomes assessment protocols at clinical sites around the country that offer various forms of CAM as well as clinics that provide the combination of conventional medicine with complementary and alternative therapies. &nbsp;PROCAIM is currently being used for a 12 month longitudinal survey to evaluate interactions among stress, symptoms, severity, and general well-being among people with fibromyalgia, IBS, chronic fatigue, and other chronic pain conditions, and the frequency and impact of co-morbid conditions among users of complementary and alternative medicines.</p>
