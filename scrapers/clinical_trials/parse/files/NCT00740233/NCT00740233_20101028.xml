<brief_summary>
<textblock>
  The investigators are inviting people with fibromyalgia, IBS, interstitial cystitis, chronic pain, and other chronic and recurring conditions to sign up and participate in a year-long Internet-based survey to study the effectiveness of alternative medicine and the interactions among stress and coping, pain, and treatment outcomes.
 
  The survey is called PROCAIM, which stands for Patient-Reported Outcomes from Complementary, Alternative, and Integrative Medicine. PROCAIM was developed under a grant to UCLA researchers from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.
 
  This is a web-based study composed of surveys that will recur at intervals over 1 year!

<detailed_descr>
<textblock>
  PROCAIM, which stands for Patient-Reported Outcomes from Complementary, Alternative, and Integrative Medicine, was developed to collect and manage longitudinal patient data and implement patient-based outcomes assessment protocols at clinical sites around the country that offer various forms of CAM as well as clinics that provide the combination of conventional medicine with complementary and alternative therapies.  PROCAIM is currently being used for a 12 month longitudinal survey to evaluate interactions among stress, symptoms, severity, and general well-being among people with fibromyalgia, IBS, chronic fatigue, and other chronic pain conditions, and the frequency and impact of co-morbid conditions among users of complementary and alternative medicines.
