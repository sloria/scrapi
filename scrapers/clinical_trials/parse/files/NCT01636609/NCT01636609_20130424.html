<th>Brief summary</th>

<tr>
<td colspan="2" class="bigdent">
<p>The goal of the Phase 1 part of this clinical research study is to learn the highest tolerable dose of cytarabine that can be given with tosedostat and the highest tolerable dose of &nbsp;5-azacitidine that can be given with tosedostat to patients with AML or MDS.<br>
<br>The goal of the Phase 2 part of the study is to learn if cytarabine with tosedostat and/or 5-azacitidine with tosedostat can help to control the disease. &nbsp;The safety of these combinations will continue to be studied.<br>
<br>Tosedostat is designed to block the production of proteins that cancer cells need to grow. &nbsp;Blocking these proteins may cause the cancer cells to die.<br>
<br>Cytarabine is designed to insert itself into DNA (genetic material) of cancer cells and stop the DNA from repairing itself.<br>
<br>5-azacitidine is designed to block certain proteins in cancer cells whose job is to stop the function of the tumor-fighting proteins. &nbsp;By blocking these proteins, the tumor-fighting genes may be able to work better.</p>

<th>Detailed description</th>

<td colspan="2" class="bigdent">
<p>Study Groups:<br>If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to receive cytarabine with tosedostat (Group 1) or 5-azacitidine (Group 2). Your doctor will decide which drugs you will receive.<br>
<br>You will be assigned to a study phase based on when you join this study. &nbsp;Up to 2 groups of about 18 participants will be enrolled in the Phase I portion of the study, and up to 60 participants will be enrolled in Phase II.<br>
<br>If you are enrolled in the Phase I portion, the dose of cytarabine or 5-azacitidine you receive will depend on when you joined this study. &nbsp;The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of cytarabine or 5-azacitidine. &nbsp;The second group will receive a higher dose of cytarabine or 5-azacitidine than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.<br>
<br>If you are enrolled in the Phase II portion, you will receive cytarabine or 5-azacitidine at the highest dose that was tolerated in the Phase I portion.<br>
<br>All participants will receive the same dose level of tosedostat.<br>
<br>Study Drug Administration:<br>In this study you receive induction therapy to try to control the disease and cause remission (the point when tests and/or your doctor cannot find signs of the disease). &nbsp;If the disease is in remission, you may receive more cycles (called Consolidation Cycles) to help keep the disease under control.<br>
<br>Each study cycle is about 4 weeks long, but may be longer depending on your response to the study drug(s).<br>
<br>Participants in both groups will take tosedostat by mouth 1 time every day. &nbsp;&nbsp;You should take the pills at about the same time every day (about 24 hours between doses) during a meal or just after a meal. &nbsp;You may take the drug with water.<br>
<br>You will be given a study drug diary, so you can record when you take each dose. You should complete this diary every day and bring it with you to all study visits. You should also bring any unused tosedostat to each study visit including all empty pots.<br>
<br>You should not take more than your assigned number of capsules within a 24-hour period. &nbsp;If you accidentally take more on 1 day, you should tell your study doctor right away. If you miss a dose in the morning then you can take the dose up until late afternoon (5pm). After that time the dose should be omitted and you should continue your drug schedule as usual the following day. &nbsp;Do not try to "make up" the missed dose after 5pm.<br>
<br>If you are in Group 1, you will also receive cytarabine by a needle under the skin 2 times each day on Days 1-10.<br>
<br>If you are in Group 2, you will also receive 5-azacitidine by vein over 10-40 minutes or by a needle under the skin each day on Days 1-7.<br>
<br>After induction, the amount of tosedostat you receive may be increased. Your doctor may decide to stop the cytarabine or 5-azacitidine and continue with tosedostat alone.<br>
<br>Study Visits:<br>On Day 1 of Cycle 1:<br>-You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.<br>-Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.<br>-Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. &nbsp;PK testing measures the amount of study drug in your body at different time points.<br>-Your performance status will be recorded.<br>-Your medical history will be recorded.<br>-You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.<br>
<br>On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1 (+/- 2 days):<br>-Your vital signs will be measured.<br>-Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.<br>-You will have an ECG.<br>-You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you may be having.<br>-On Day 8 only, you will have a physical exam.<br>-On Day 15 only, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for PK testing.<br>
<br>On Day 28 of Cycle 1 (+/- 5 days) (this visit may be combined with the Day 1 of Cycle 2 visit):<br>-You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.<br>-Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.<br>-Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for PK testing.<br>-Your performance status will be recorded.<br>-You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you may be having.<br>-You will have an ECG.<br>-You will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease.<br>
<br>On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond (+/- 5 days):<br>-You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.<br>-Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.<br>-Your performance status will be recorded.<br>-You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you may be having.<br>-You will have an ECG.<br>-During Cycles 2 and 3 only, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for PK testing.<br>-During odd-numbered cycles (3, 5, 7 and so on), you will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease.<br>
<br>If your study doctor feels it is needed, you may have extra clinic visits, tests, or procedures.<br>
<br>Participants Receiving Home Care:<br>If you will receive the first cycle at home, you will be called on Day 14 (+/- 5 days) of Cycle 1 and asked about any side effects you may be having. This call will take about 15 minutes.<br>
<br>If you are receiving home care, you will return to MD Anderson before the start of each cycle During Cycles 1-3, then every 3 cycles (+/- 1 cycle) until 1 year after the start of therapy, and then every 6 months (+/- 1 month) after that.<br>
<br>Length of Study:<br>You may take the study drug for up to 1 year. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, if you have intolerable side effects, if you are not able to follow the study directions, or if the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest.<br>
<br>Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the follow-up.<br>
<br>Follow-Up:<br>About 28 days after your last dose of tosedostat:<br>-You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.<br>-Your performance status will be recorded.<br>-Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.<br>-You will have an ECG.<br>-You will be asked about any side effect that you may have had and any drugs you may be taking.<br>
<br>Once you have completed the follow-up visit, the study staff may contact you by telephone every 3-6 months to check the status of your health. &nbsp;Keeping in touch with you and checking on your condition will help researchers look at the long-term effects of the study drug.<br>
<br>This is an investigational study. &nbsp;Tosedostat is not FDA approved or commercially available. &nbsp;At this time, tosedostat is only being used in research. Cytarabine is FDA approved and commercially available for certain types of MDS and AML. 5-azacitidine is FDA approved and commercially available for certain types of MDS and AML.<br>
<br>Up to 96 patients will take part in this study. All patients will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</p>
